Sarah,"I ordered this swimsuit in a large, I usually wear a medium/large - for reference I am 5'7"", 165 pounds, hourglass body type and wear a 36C. The suit was a little tight for me, dug into my hips, butt, and back. I'd recommend going up a size.I absolutely love the style with the mesh insert and high neckline. It is a very sexy swimsuit while still making you feel covered up, takes away the worry of spilling out of a swim top while still showing some cleavage. There's a cute band underneath the breasts that helps contour and hold the girls up which is a great detail that I hadn't really noticed when purchasing the suit. There's not as much ruching on the abdomen, as other suits I've tried on but it does the job of slimming and hiding my little tummy pouch. Overall, it's a great suit, just be careful on sizing.I hope this review was helpful (and you hit the helpful review button ;) thanks)"
Kali,"Ok.  I NEVER wear a one piece swimsuit! I 33 years old and I tall (59-510) so I have a longer torso. My weight fluctuates but I normally 200ish. one piece suits are normally too short and jacked up in all the wrong places! After reading all of the reviews, I decided to try.  I have weight on me but luckily my weight spreads equally for the most part however I small in the boob area, which makes it hard.  Most 歷긳rvy friendly clothing is larger in the boobs.  I decided to try this suit and was pleasantly surprised! It stays put, it long enough in the torso (I normally wear a 14 in pants and wear a L-XL depending on how it made) so after reading the comments I ordered up and ordered a 0x to make sure it fit in the torso.  I hate telling personal details but it helps people to know height/weight to make a decision.  In my opinion thesis suit fits and is very flattering.  Good luck! :)"
Heather,"I love this suit! I headed to a cruise with my husband and another couple and was looking for suits that made me feel sexy without looking like a fool. This suit totally did it for me! I checked the dimensions and ordered accordingly, perfect fit (Ordered a 0X/14W - I 59 and 200 pounds)! I can wait to prance around the ship while throwing back margaritas with my crew!"
Michelle,"I ordered an XL which is my normal size (Size 16 dress, XL top) I loved the mesh and it fit great (not a fan of the cups but they are removable)! It had great support and looked cute! It was a bit tough to get on because of the key hole (?) back but fit perfectly!"
Samantha 腰껅큶腰껅낱,"This swimsuit deserves a review. It so great. It fits me like a glove. I recently lost over 40 pounds. So I haven owned a swimsuit in years and I not interested in trying them on in a store. So I spent days looking and reading reviews and I finally ordered 3 swimsuits with the thought Ireturn them if they didn work. For reference I 53 almost 54 and I weigh 136 pounds. In Victoria secrets I wear a 34DD and medium panties. I hope that helps. Because I don measure myself ever. I purchased a size medium in black. And I will be buying another one. Not kidding, it makes me feel sexy and comfortable and covered up. Not feeling too naked or hoe-ish!  This swimsuit came quickly and is definitely worth more then they are charging! Let hope after boating and washing it that it holds up! If it falls to peices Il update this review. But do ya self a favor if you have been searching endlessly for a swimsuit. Just buy this one!"
ALLISON SPADE,"I love this bathing suit. It's equally conservative yet I feel beautiful in it. I was looking for something that I could wear to the water park or beach with the kids but I didn't want a typical plain bathing suit. I am 5'7, 140 lbs and a size 4/6pants, D chest. I bought a medium and fits perfect, not too tight or loose. Would def recommend."
Hannah Mitchell,"Review from Hannah:This suit is perfect! I look terrible in one pieces, always have! I wanted something that was modest yet looked a little sexy, Il be drinking (a lot) on our honeymoon cruise next month and don want to show anything on accident if I happen to get too drunk lolI 55, 165lbs, 38 bust, 31 waist, and 42 hips and the large was perfect for me! My thighs are huge, so usually one pieces dig into them, but this one fits them perfect! I also have a very long torso, so the fact this fit me long wise was a win in itself!!"
Katie,"Loved it, wish had more boob support too but it could have been much worse! It was tight enough to give some body shaping support, quality material, and covered in all the right places. Very satisfied!! Much better quality and fit than more expensive suits that I've bought at popular brick & mortar retail stores!!"
Carlos Pinero,"I read the reviews and decided to order the suit and give it a try. I typically can find suits online and have to try on a dozen or more. I was shocked when I put it on and it fit perfectly! I am 510 with a long torso. I wear a solid size 16 and I a 38D cup size. I ordered the 1X after looking through reviews of people who wear similar sizes. I definitely wouldn go any smaller-this fit perfectly. My bust is supported and contained nicely. The fit on the legs is excellent and my butt is covered without looking like a grandma suit. Ie had six kids (including twins) and my stomach isn perfect. I feel very comfortable in this suit. I very impressed!  The quality isn like that of some of my more expensive suits, but for the price it is worth every penny. I would recommend and order again in another color."
Elizabeth F.,"I don usually write clothing reviews and I feel very vulnerable putting this out there for the world to see however, if I can help JUST ONE woman find her perfect suit and feel great then It is entirely worth it. I am 27, a mom of 2, 58, 198 lbs, 34C, typically a med/lg top and between a size 12-14 in jeans. Most of my weight is all in my legs and butt and I ordered the 0W(US14) for an anbeleiveable fit!!!THIS SUIT...WOW. I HAVE NEVER found a suit that provides so much coverage and is still perfectly flattering. I walked all around my house today in this swimsuit to see if it was going to ride up and it never did. I have a decently long torso and longer legs. The suit is more than long enough to fit and there is still a lot of stretch left in the suit.The breast pads are perfectly placed. The mesh between shows the right amount of cleavage to spice it up a bit and the rouching around the stomach hides anything you might now want others to see and provides a little hug to your tummy smoothing everything out. The collar is a little different but it is NOT tight at all. The back of the swimsuit covers my abnormally large rear end better than any suit ive ever found, no riding up, no wedgie, no shrinking into a tiny panel exposing both cheeks.If youe thinking about this swimsuit, do it and you will not regret it!"
Rachael,So I wanted a medium but they only had small at the time for prime so I went with the small. I'm 5'4 125 pounds. It was a little tight but now that I have worn it a lot it feels better I love it so much! Wish they had more colors. I doesn't cover my butt so well but I always wear swim shorts over it.
SammieRae,"I'm so sad. This is the cutest suit ever but they sent me a used one! Deoderant stains on the pits, full of sand, pantyliner ripped off. Gross. Anyways, thankfully a friend of mine ordered the same one and I was able to try hers on to see if it would fit. Sizing is pretty on point. I'm a normal size 10/12 and bought the Large. Im 5'4"" 175 pounds and it fit like a glove. Comfy and stylish. Sexy but still covers up my mom bits at the beach. Going on a family vacation with my inlaws and I could totally get away wearing this. If your looking for shapewear this isnt the suit for you. It doesnt have that but still very cute on Amazon is sending me another one soon. Hopefully QC sends me a new one this time!"
alfie fernandez,"I bought this suit on a whim, after reading an article on social media, of how much this item was selling on Amazon. Honestly, I haven't found a comfortable, decent looking bathing suit in so many years, and after spending lots of money on expensive brands, I truly didn't expect much from a $25 suit, but, after spending an afternoon reading reviews, I was sold. Also, according to the size chart, I was too big for the available sizes, but thanks to the reviews of the lovely ladies here (thanks!) I figured out a size 16 Plus just might work. My measurements are 5'3"" 230 lbs bra 42D, waist 42"" and hips 52"".  I have Prime but, the suit was sent via USPS and it was delayed by 1 day, which was very inconvenient, as I wanted to wear it to the beach, but, oh well. Anyway, when I finally got it and put it on...WOZA! absolute perfection! my husband said I looked 20 pounds thinner, it is soooo flattering! oh my goodness! the fabric is the right thickness, and just holds everything in without discomfort. I bent over and it covers everything, and it looks so stylish! I was a bit concerned the mesh would make it look tacky, but it just looks very classy. DO NOT HESITATE! I will buy it in more colors, it is gorgeous. I can't vouch for longevity, or how it will be after wet, but the hundreds of positive reviews say it all."
Jesse & Flanny,"I am obsessed with this suit. I am 53 and usually wear a size 14-16, needless to say, bathing suits are not usually my friend. I feel like a goddess in this suit. I can imagine it great for serious swimming, but it is perfect for enjoying the hot tub or lounging at the beach "
Amazon Customer,"I ordered the S size.  I am 53, 126 lbs, 34c, size 4 top, 6 pants and this is a perfect fit."
Mary,"I'm 5'1"" 115 lbs, ordered the navy blue in a size small, and it fits perfectly. I was apprehensive about buying this because 1. The cost is so low. and 2. The blue color shown is a bad Photoshop. But everything checked out! The suit is of good quality, looks great on, and the color is a pretty navy blue. The kind of navy where it actually looks blue, not so dark it looks almost black. I haven't worn it to the pool yet, so I can't comment on how it does in the water, but I'm really looking forward to wearing it on my vacation next month.The only thing I didn't enjoy about my purchase was reading the description on this item. Saying that this item is for ""chubby girls and young moms""? Come on..Why would you say that? It's really not necessary. I'm neither of these, and I purchased it. Labels are for soup cans, just let the swimsuit speak for itself."
McKenzie Rowell,Yll ready for the most real review? I LOVED the bathing suit online and I went based off of several reviews and got one that definitely didn fit. So I here to give it to you straight. I 53 150lbs (give or take I mean let face it I don jump to get on a scale) I am a 32DD wand lets just say I not lacking in the behind and hips (as I a mother of twins). I got a size medium so if you want something too tight that sounds like it going to rip at any given moment when you finally get it past your thighs (and butt) and put it on only to have HALF of your butt cheeks out and feel like youe in a skin suit then a medium is the size for you. However I will be returning this and getting a size LARGE. Needless to say in my humble opinion I would size up if you want it to fit you right (if you have a similar body style).  Otherwise I LOVE this bathing suit it was very modest yet sexy for us moms out there. I also did not post a picture as I didn think about it before taking it off and don even want to chance ripping it before I send it back.
Andrea,"I 53 160lbs and 36DD+ (nursing) I ordered a medium in navy blue and it fits well. Though I should have probably gotten a large. ( I planning on dropping more weight before summer) The leg holes were a little snug, but nothing uncomfortable and it held my girls in!! This is one of the only bathing suits Ie found that can do that! The cups are small and very structured, but I took them out and put in another pair I had. There isn much tummy support but every little bit helps when you are post partum. All in all I love it. And if for some reason I don drop the weight I will come back and order a large :) hope this helps!"
Meranda J.,"I 5 8, 210 lbs. My measurements are 40-42-52. I am between a D-cup & DD-cup. I wear a size 18-20 in most clothing lines, and I have an apple body shape.I ordered this suit in a size 16.It is huge from the rib cage up. There is no breast support at all, and the top half hangs off, or gapes open, where it meets both arm pits. The bottom (waist/stomach area) fits ok.This is not flattering on me, and I am dissapointed with the purchase. Even in the correct size, which I can begin to guess what is, the lack of breast support is a no go."
Jane,I recently gained 20lbs and was depressed about swimsuit shopping. Loved how so many women sent their pictures in and every one of them looked amazing in this suit so decided to order it. Love love it and I now confident enough to wear this on a upcoming cruise.
Alyssa C,"I don't post pictures, but I love this swimsuit. I'm a size 16/18, 38DDD bra & ordered a 1x. It's flattering. No gaping anywhere. Fits snug, but not tight. For the price, this is one of the best suits I've ordered!"
Rhiannon Talbot,"I really like this bathing suit. It covers well, hides back fat and all the squishy places in the front. I got a size 16. I wear a 14 pant at Lane Bryant and most places. The fabric isn't the best. It feels fine but this suit probably won't last through next year. It is nice though and I am glad I took the risk."
K Martez,"I was very pleasantly surprised as I had gone suit shopping at several different stores, and couldn't find anything that I liked.  This fit perfectly as expected, and is very comfortable to hang out at the beach with my 3 kids.  I am about 5'4 and 145 lbs and the medium was perfect."
KBob,"This is a really cute swimsuit, high quality and the fit was almost great.  In fact, it fit really well, EXCEPT the bottom part is so high cut that you almost might as well be wearing a thong!  If you don't mind having about 3/4 of your rear end hanging out, then definitely buy this suit, because it is super cute, but if you are self-conscious about your behind, or modest and old, like me, then I would not recommend this particular suit.  Too bad!  For reference, I am 5'3"", 125 lbs, and I do a lot of strength training, so I have a round bottom, so that's probably why this suit didn't work for me.  If you have a little behind, it should work well!"
Kathy Jobe,"Awesome!  The suit fits well and looks stylish with the low keyhole back and the see-though mesh in front..  Still  lots of coverage  I'm 76 years old and considered buying a swim dress for more coverage.  I'm so glad I tried this one as it is perfect and looks so much more in style but doesn't make me feel self conscious.  The neck band is a little tricky to fasten, but doable.  I bought the black for a more slimming look.  If you've priced swim suits at other sites, you know that this is a great price.  All in all, it's a winner!"
carom1,"Fits great! I firmly believe that all bodies are bikini bodies, except for mine, of course. Mid 20s 5'6"", 38DD, 175-210 lbs and bought the 0X in black. My ""padding"" is evenly distributed everywhere except my butt because the universe has a sense of humor. I'm a busty lady and with both weight gain and loss and poor skin elasticity, my gal pals generally don't sit up without heavy machinery. They look great in this suit, though! It shows enough skin that I feel age appropriate and confident, which is a first for me. I take out the b00b padding and wash them with the suit and re-insert once dry. I've worn it in pools, lakes and oceans, and it's held up really well even after over a dozen wash/dry cycles (I'm generally not patient enough to separate delicates or hang dry either). This suit doesn't sag in the booty once it's wet either. I have a similarly aged Victoria's Secret swimsuit that was $110 that hasn't held up nearly as well. I purchased both the green and the red at the same time, but they are both much brighter in person and I felt like a granny smith and red not-so-delicious apple, respectively."
Janel Reyneke,"Quite a beautiful bathing suit. I really loved how the chest/neck fit. While I believe the L would have had better tummy control, the XL fit perfectly in the chest area giving me the best cleavage I've had in a while. :) I actually purchased an XL and an L since Chinese-made clothing sometimes doesn't fit me as expected; planning to return the one that didn't fit...but since I'm still losing weight and love this swimsuit so much, I'm going to keep the smaller size for when I lose more weight."
Andrew Garcia,"Very sexy n mom approved, this fits great as expected, I got XL I'm a size 11 38 D , it's good quality thick material one of my top 3 bathing suits this summer, the sheer is awesome the sheer is front in the bust area and the back , I love it! The folded material in the front does its job hides the belly fat lol it's an awesome bathing suit"
OhSoChewey,"Good quality.  I'm 5'4"", 39.5/29/38.  It fit well everywhere but was a tad too short in length so the collar dug into my collar bones a little.  I don't think I could've sized up.  This size large would fit someone with similar dimensions but who has a little less weight, bust, curves, length (whatever) than me.  It almost worked but the other suit I ordered was way more comfortable because of the length issue so I'm returning this one."
ANRamsey,I ordered this hesitantly. I hate buying swim suites online. This was a great surprise! I looks great on and is super comfortable.  I loved it so much I immediately got on and bought another in a different color! This from someone who tries on 20 suites a year. Has a mini break down then settles on one. Lol. I am 5'4 with athletic build curvy. So it's hard finding things that are flattering
Cini,"This bathing suit is modern retro. It's classy, sophisticated, and still sexy. I'm very flat chested with a petite frame and a slightly curvy thigh and but area, so one pieces don't always work for me. WOW this is close to perfect on me! My one complaint is that there isn't more butt coverage. If you're curvy or have a large caboose it might ride up too much. Other than that I absolutely recommend it! The price is incredible for what you get. This is one of those things that flatters a variety of figures."
Sml2015,"This is a great bathing suit! Ie always had a hard time finding something comfortable and this one was perfect. I wore it to the spa and went between the steam room, sauna, hot tub and a mineral pool and didn once feel uncomfortable a bit. There are 2 layers in the middle so one is tight and holds everything in while the top layer keeps it from suctioning to you when getting out of the water. Loved it!!"
cat,"The overall design of this swimsuit is very cute, but someone needs to work on the cups! They are made of a VERY firm material and are large and perfectly round, so they stand out (literally) in the silky swimsuit material. It makes the wearer look like something out of a mid-90s Madonna video, or like you have a pair of targets on your chest.Swapping the current cups out for a softer foam (like in every other swimsuit Ie ever worn) would solve the problem.I was sad to return it because the swimsuit is really cute and fit great - but there is just no way!"
J. Ulrich,"I am understanding exactly what a few reviewers meant when they said it was a bit ""cheeky"" now. I'm about 5'6"" 147 lbs. I ordered a medium. The suit does look and feel great, however I had to return because when I clasped the neck in the back it was a little too tight around my neck at my throat and didn't seem like it would be comfortable to swim in. I know me and I would have also spent a lot of time pulling it over my butt cheeks. I have considered ordering a large to see if it makes a difference with those issues because I do really love the look of it."
Hanaberry,"First off, let me just say that bathing suit shopping has always been an absolute nightmare for me. The top part of the suit is always too small, my rolls are always poking out around my back amd waistline and the straps always dig in. I found this while reading an article on Buzzfeed, clicked on the Amazon link, saw all of the positive reviews and decided to go for it. I went with the 16 plus. I am 57, 220 lbs and a 40DD. I cannot begin to explain how comfortable and how flattering this is. NO visible rolls (miracle #1), the top part of the suit supports me very well and actually flatters me in that area which has ALWAYS been a problem (miracle #2) AND even with the weight of my chest, the neck strap is insanely comfortable and does not tug (miracle #3). I am absolutely amazed. I will be ordering more colors ASAP!"
Mrs. Bush,"I'm a size 16, weigh 210lbs. I ordered a 1x and it fit me perfectly. I'm one that is pretty picky about my swimsuits as I am a plus sized women and I don't like all my goods hanging out. I loved the back part as it covered my back fat and the front sheer area made my chest look great. It was more like a sports fit which made me feels comfortable because I have an athletic build body. I plan to purchase more in different colors, this is the type of fit I've been looking for and even my husband loves it. Thanks"
Liz and Tiger Hoover,"Based off the size chart, I felt safe with the Medium because I am usually a true medium and never have an issue with that size. I actually underweight at the moment, so I figured it would be a little big and I could move back into my normal weight without issue. But the Medium was actually really tight on my smaller than medium body... so I returned it and ordered the Large. Much better fit. The style is pretty and flattering and I a huge fan of this swimsuit- just be cautious about the sizing."
MelissaRN,Bought this for Cancun getaway.. very very sexy and flattering. The back come high up and the dreaded ack fat that some bathing suits cause are curved with this one.
Candita,I am really fussy when it comes to bathing suits. But this one is really comfortable. Im 150 pounds and i ordered a large. I may have been able to get away with a medium but to avoid my boobs falling out the sides and to get full butt coverage i decided to take the large. I wore the bathing suit as a body suit to a party paired with some culottes and i think it lookes great. A very versatile piece.
val,"I loved the bathing suit at first, BUT only wore it about 3-4 times and now the thin lace on the front and sides are ripping. Coming apart, strings coming out on the lace. So, a waste of money to only be able to wear it a few times. I have paced the return window since I bought it 1 month before the summer started."
jsharp13,"In general happy with this suit, for around $25.  I ordered the 1X and I'm around a size 16-18.  I would say there was a little buldge in the back area, above the suit material, but it was disguised by the mesh.  The back is a little unusual and so I probably won't get a lot of sun in this suit but it is certainly pretty, and something different to add to the rotation."
E Hanna,"Absolutely LOVE this suit. I hate swim suit shopping in general, let alone online, but I took a chance! I feel AMAZING in this suit! I never say that about a swim suit! The style is so complimentary of my body type. Modest, yet super attractive! I am usually a med to large in tops (34DD), smaller on the bottom. I ordered a large and it was perfect. I seriously love this suit!"
Medford OR,"The suit fits perfectly like other reviews have mentioned. I was very surprised. There ruching on the lower front part, but it doesn add thickness to your waist and abdomen. The green color is prettier than the photo, sexy but modest. The back seat is not up too high and embarrassing (I 60) or down too low and matronly. The top covers side boob and stops at a spot on the back that, for me, doesn cause lab spill-over. The bottom sides come up to the perfect level for me. I petite, 5 tall, 115# and usually there way to much length in a one piece for me, but this fits just right. I think youl have to check how it fits 56+ ladies considering that I don see a lot of extra length here. Although I have another one piece green suit, Il keep this. It more of a jewel color, slightly blue-green, that I imagine would compliment many complexions. I Caucasian with a medium skin tone, silver-blonde hair, green eyes. My only complaint is that it arrived smelling faintly of smoke. It was clean with the crotch plastic in place, but this is a reminder that we are apparently passing these swimsuits around, so wash them thoroughly before wearing and try them on at home with undergarments as you would at the store. The smell went away after laundering. I used W**lite in the washer and even dried it in the dryer since it obviously had been worn. The seams stood up and the fit didn change. It isn made out of the most expensive fabric, so I don know how nice itl keep or for how long, but it a fraction of the price Ie paid for suits that fit worse. Ihighly recommend with the aforementioned caveat that it had been tried on probably a couple time by others"
Avid Reader,"At 5ft and 140llbs I wanted a bathing suit with ruching/pleats for the middle of waist and stomach. Well, I was quite surprised of how well it fit me in the front! Very flattering! However, the back was awful!! The backside did not fit me properly! My butt cheeks were hanging out! And I am a small petite woman! Had to return! I think suit is made for taller women not 5ft petite women!"
India DuBois,"SUPER cute. Love the cut and style. I'm tempted to buy this again but in a different color! I wore this on the beach day of a bachelorette weekend and received a lot of compliments. We were out in the sun for a few hours and I was comfortable. When we went shopping and walking around the beach town, I complimented this bathing suit with a kimono cover-up and jean shorts -  it was cute and appropriate for dining at the restaurant. Also, note that the holes in the mesh are close enough together that it does give some sun protection. I still used sunscreen under those mesh parts, but did notice that I did not tan as deeply in those areas.I will note that it was a little smaller than I expected. I'm, 5'2"" and normally wear a L or 12/14 because of my boobs (38D), so in this case it was tight in that area, but the XL would have been too loose in all the other areas. I recommend using the sizing guide featured in the pictures."
Amazon Customer,It smelled like cigarettes... as soon as I opened the bag the smell slapped me on the face. The most disgusting thing that ever happened to me on an amazon purchase.
Amy Fulmer,"After having my second Baby a year ago, Ie been struggling to find a suit that will hold everything in and still look cute. I think this is going to fit the bill. For reference I am 54, 165 lbs- hopefully going down, and a 34 DD and ordered the large. The suit has nice rouching in the middle to hide the baby pooch on me and keeps the girls in upstairs while still being cute. The material is a bit thinner than most other suits so I not sure about the longevity of it playing with the kids in the sand, etc. But when we head out for vacation next month I will update with any changes. For the price, if I can get one season out of it that would be great."
Angelia B.,I just got this suit and love it. It super cute on and comfortable. I am going to share my size and pics because I used the reviews and pics of other women to purchase this suit. I am 56 and about 200lbs and wear a 34DD to 36DD so hopefully that will help you in choosing a new swimsuit that makes you happy. My husband really liked this on me. I like that it has full coverage with a little sexy thrown in. I will be keeping this one. I haven worn this outside or to water so we shall see. It easy to pull on and take off also the buckle is super easy to reach! Love it.
Amazon Customer,I love this swim suit it was a little big on me though im 5'2 and I weigh 205 I recently lost 45lbs and I wanted to get a swimsuit that was sexy but still had some coverage for our honey moon my husband loved it. I just wish I would have purchased a smaller size 0X
Duck,"I'm a big girl in denial and bought a large. Fit somewhat small. HOWEVER, I gain and lose weight frequently so I'm not going to judge the product on it. The neck part was a bit chokey, and the material left my skin a little red, however, this can go back to the small size problem which was my mistake.Keep in mind you might not need a size up, swimsuits are usually stretchy and you can probably get away with a Large if you run a size 12-14."
Amazon Customer,"I don't usually like to order bathing suits online because I like to try on a bunch in the store.  I'm a size 12 and wear a 38C or D bra.  This fit me nicely in an XL.  I got the black to try to hide my 2 c-section belly and it did nicely.  It's not a tummy slimming suit (compression) like my other suits but it looks nice.  I don't know if other colors would hide it as well as black.  Can't wait to wear it to an indoor water park in a couple of weeks.  My husband commented that it looked a little slutty but oh well, I don't think so.  Looking forward to a mini vacation with my new suit."
amazonian3,"As an apple-shaped individual, I carry a lot of my extra weight in my midsection, which is something I can work with in terms of regular apparel, but it a real challenge with swimwear.  Based on the reviews, I had medium-high hopes for the fit of this particular suit on my shape.  My expectations were exceeded!  Somehow it gives the illusion of a waist, and it accentuates one of my favorite features, my shoulders. It modest without being matronly or fussy, and the little cleavage panel adds a lot without making me feel worried about nip slips. For reference, I 52, 200 lbs, and I ordered the 1X/16W,  and it fits perfectly."
Suzi,"I love this swimsuit!  I almost never order a one-piece, but decided to give this a try with so many great reviews.  I'm 5'4"", 145 pounds and on the cusp of a medium or large according to the size chart.  I ordered a large according to the hip measurement because I'm pear-shaped, which turned out to be the right choice.  This suit is well-constructed and the style is extremely flattering.  The sheer panels give the suit a little extra visual interest and sex appeal."
Taylor,"Ie lost a lot of weight recently and have some stretch marks from my previous weight gain. This suit covers the areas I self-conscious about AND is super flattering on my stomach. I have a little pooch and the combination of the black color and uching on this suit really slims down the pooch. I cannot say better things about this suit quality and fit. For reference, I 58 and I weigh 154 lbs and I got a Medium."
Jenna P.,"For the record, I am about 5'10 and 200 pounds, fitting into anything from a 12-16 (usually a 14), XL, and a 38F bra. I was really concerned that this would not fit, but was pleasantly surprised. I had to shimmy into it a little, but it was pretty comfortable overall. It wasn't too tight or too loose on my stomach area and surprisingly this kept my breasts secure, they didn't move much (though I did have to take out the padding that came with it because it just didn't look right).CON: With my height and the design of the suit, there was hardly any room for stretching or adjusting to my height. My torso is long, along with my neck/shoulder area. The suit is tight and pulls there, so to make up for the pain, I have to pull the bottom of the suit up higher. By doing this, my butt doesn't have 100% coverage, but more like 90%. The struggle with minor discomfort is, in my opinion, worth everything else. The suit is beautiful, classic, timeless & really is flattering on most body types. I only gave 4 stars because its not inclusive for tall gals."
DJ,"Sorry to all the bloggers out there that think this suit is the bomb. What a disappointment!  Do not waste your time. Cheaply made, this suit sounds like it was ripping apart at the seams just trying it on. I 53nd bought a Medium  and the torso was so short, I could hardly get the clasp to fit at my neck!  Not sure how anyone tall could wear it. I should have known better."
swalke90,"I LOVE this bathing suit. It very flattering, does a good job with tummy control, and still makes me feel sexy with the see-through areas. My only complaint is that it does ride pretty high on the hips. I 53 and 175lb and got a large. When I first put it on, it almost feels like the top part is choking me a little and the bottom is riding up really high on my hips, sort of like I need a shorter torso for the suit to fit exactly right. I already fairly short so I imagine if you are tall, this suit is going to ride VERY high on your hips. However, when the suit gets wet or after Ie been walking around in it for a litte bit, it seems to stretch a bit and then it no longer an issue. Just something to keep in mind! If I were to buy another one Iprobably go a size up and see if that helps."
Amy B,"I wanted to love this like so many other reviewers...but it just wasn't long enough in the torso or cut quite generously enough to cover my (ample) rear. I'm 5' 7"", 145 lbs and pear shaped with a long torso. Am sending back because I think I would constantly be dealing with a wedgie. I'm also not very large chested..so the front mesh panel and styling wasn't doing much for me. I think on a different body type this suit would be great."
debra,"I read 100's of reviews on this suit and was really expecting something spectacular.  Others my size  (5'4"" 138 lbs) ordered a M so I did too . It was so small I could barely get it on.  The V neck was wide and showed more than a little cleavage, nothing like what I saw in photos.  The high neck was tight and uncomfortable. Where the suit back met the mesh straps I had bulges.  The front bra part was just weird - all puckery and made my chest look really wide.  It just wasn't at all what I expected.  I did like the legs.  Just the right height (not too low like some one-pieces are)  and not to tight so there was no bulging.  Returning as I know I will never go in public in this suit."
spring,What a shame!!!! This suit is lovely on and it handles my DD boobs with ease and it comfortable BUT I have worn it 4 times and only hand washed it and the sheer mesh is starting to show severe signs of wear as if I have had it years!  And of course no return option at this point.
L. Robak,"I am quite happy with this reasonably priced swimsuit.  In fact, I just ordered it in another color!  I was most worried about supporting the girls (they are heavy and not so perky anymore)  It seems to do the job fairly well.  I ordered it originally in a large and it was just a bit too big so I returned and got the medium. (this review title shows it is a black large, so maybe I clicked on the wrong one to review....but this is the medium) It needs to be a little snug to hold things in and give support.  I am 5'2 and 145 pounds, 34 DD if that helps with choosing a size.  The biggest con I'd say....it could use a bit more support in the side boob area....or maybe it just needs to be a little tighter.  But still, it works well enough and I feel I have coverage but not like I'm wearing an old lady swim suit.  I am going to take it to Cabo in a few weeks.  I hope it holds up well in the ocean and pool.  (and continues to hold me up!)  This one is navy and I love it. I had the hardest time choosing a second color!"
AC,Love this swimsuit. Fit me perfectly. I took the removal cups out. It works better for me without the cups. Otherwise this is a good quality suit. Good modest cut yet very attractive on. I followed the measurement guidelines and comments on reviews and decided and this size fit me perfectly. I am 5'0 tall 120 pounds. I have a 32D cup.
Kindle Customer,"Super cute and nice quality.  I am a mix of the listed XL & XL-Plus sizes and had ordered the XL.  It was too ""short"", making it very difficult to fasten the hook at the back, and very uncomfortable once I did.  This actually helped my evaluation, because the mesh (which I thought would rip easily, withstood the tight fitting AND the suit looked super cute!  Great color.  I returned (very smooth process) and reordered the XL-Plus.  I love it.  I would say if you have questions/concerns about size, go a size up and enjoy!"
Amanda B.,"Get this suit. It even makes my lumpy self look good. 5'5"" and an embarrassing 182# and I needed a new suit for the summer. I can't do halters, they kill my neck, and I need some chest support for my Ds, and I hate straps sliding down. I like 1 piece suits because I like to play and have fun in the water but I don't want to look like a frumpy 39 year old either. This suit is incredibly flattering, snug enough to hold you in and still be very comfortable and easy to move in. My chest is well supported and sexy without feeling exposed or like my boobs are gonna escape. The clasped back means straps won't fall down and no pressure on my neck. I can't recommend this suit enough. Buy it. You don't have to be thin and sexy like some of the reviewers here, but I promise you'll feel great in this suit."
Elaina Martinez,"I've been in search of a flattering yet not boring one-piece for a long time, and finally found it!I am:5'11Curvy in the hips and bootySmall to medium size chestI bought a: Large in blackI was looking for:1. Straps that flattered my neckline, showed more shoulder2. Classy cleavage3. A suit with a higher back so I don't have to worry about back fat (even though we all have it)4. Comfortable for activity- I wanted a suit that was cute but still sporty enough for water activities5. Butt coverage that let my curves live their best life without digging in and creating a weird shapeThis suit hits all points! My boyfriend absolutely loved this suit on me, thought it was really classy yet sexy and it fits perfectly! I will be buying more!"
Heather Davis,"Love this swimsuit! I typically wear tankinis to hide my post-baby belly but I always kinda feel theye not very sexy or flattering. I took a chance based on all the positive reviews and I was not disappointed. I 55, 165 and typically wear a size 12 or women large. I bought the lg and it fits great. I going to have to buy more colors!"
Ann M.,"Quality of sewing is poor.  Just to let you know the material is thin, so if you are a larger woman and need support this may not be for you.  I am 53 134lbs 34C.  I wear a Medium in this suit and have some extra room. There is no bra for support in this bathing suit, which is OK for me, but if you are blessed and need support this may not be for you. I was so happy when I received my first navy blue swim suit which was actually from a different company. It was perfect! ( 3rd pic)  Then I came across Tempt Me Brand and the suits look exactly the same. I ordered the black one first. Well, as you can see in the second picture, it was delivered defective.  Ever who sewed this suit pinched the mesh fabric by neck! It looks awful. I was just going to exchange it, but they no longer had any mediums. So I got online to see what other color I could pick instead. That is when I found wine red. I ordered the wine red and it arrived last night. Well low and behold going down the left side ever who sewed it totally missed the fabric and didn even sew part of it altogether!  I had already started the process to send back the black suit when I decided to see if a seamstress could fix that area instead because we are going on vacation and I really liked how I looked in that suit.  So that suit ended up costing me more money and now I getting ready to call her and see what she would charge me to finish sewing the red wine one also. I have just been so disappointed with Tempt Me and will not be ordering from this company again."
Amazon Customer,It was very cute and fit great...however it ripped as soon as i put it on... ot becaise it didnt fit but because its cheaply made and i am sending it back
Lynn,"I tried this suit in an XL and 16W/1X just in case.  For reference, I'm short (particularly in the torso) & VERY curvy, about 175 pounds and I wear 14/16's.  The XL looked great except for the wonky pads, which may have been in the right place on a taller/longer torso.  Unfortunately, the armholes felt a smidge open/loose on the sides - unexpected since I'm a US 32L bust - so I am afraid the side boob risk would be too high for swimming laps.  I need it to be more firm at the top to give me some support but sizing down would result in the leg holes being too tight.  The 16W fit as expected and was consistent in size given the XL experience:  a little longer and wider in all directions.  I would absolutely recommend giving this suit a whirl if you're top heavy or very curvy because it is gorgeous.  The colors I tried (burgundy/merlot and malachite green) were true to illustrations.  I'm returning both suits, but I may rebuy the XL and pay to have the top altered if I can't find something else in short order."
C. Teleki,"Ie been trying lots of suits and can find anything non-underwire for my 36H nursing bust. I 55 153 and ordered an XL. The chest was too small to cover well, not supportive on the sides, and came with funny little circles of padding that made my breasts look misshapen. The rest of the suit was a bit too baggy. I can see why so many people love this suit though - the quality seems great and the style would be flattering on someone less endowed than I am at the moment. Maybe when I back to DD I will give it another try in a L, but for now it going back."
Ian and Jenya,"It just arrived yesterday, so this is an early review (not sure how it will hold up when I take it to vegas this weekend.) It smells weird upon opening and the latch on the neck is made of plastic...I am a little concerned how it will hold up. BUT, WOW, it looks really great on! I ordered a large, I am a solid 10 in pants & a medium or petite large in women's shirts. My bust is 38D, my waist 30"" & my weight 154, I am 5'3"". It was not super tight...I may have been able to do a medium, but I am glad I went with a large. It has nice ruching around the mid section and the peekaboo chest is super sexy. I usually use more cover up, like swim shorts or suits with built in skirts...but this suit looks great and I highly recommend it. I don't think I will use any cover ups this time! I will report back if anything changes after use."
C. Lovegrove,"The swimming suit fits exactly as I expected.  The breast cups, however, are the smallest cups I have ever had in a swimsuit.  I order the plus size, but the cups were maybe an A cup.  This makes the suit fit really weird in the breast panels with an very odd shaped 'bump' on your boob.  I will probably keep the suit and wear it when no one will see me because it's comfortable, but it's the strangest thing ever."
Hannah,"Stumbled across this suit after searching. I always skeptical when it comes to buying clothes online but I glad I made this purchase and I totally mean that! I am 54 and weigh 185. I wear a large T-shirt but ordered an XL. I was looking for something to support my chest because I breastfeed so I need the extra support and nothing to fall out of my top. Was also looking for a suit with a comfortable fit in the abdominal area and this suit is just that. This swimsuit does it for me, and it also very flattering!"
emersyn,"I wish this suit had fit, because I love the look and the quality seemed really nice. I wanted a classy and modest one piece that still had a wow factor. The high neck with the mesh were perfect.Unfortunately this suit did not fit me at ALL! I am 5'9"" and 140 lbs - I usually wear a size 6. I ordered a M in this suit. I have a long torso so finding swimsuits and rompers that fit well can be a challenge. This suit was way too short for me - it pulled down at the neck and the bottom part pulled up uncomfortably. I also have a big butt and the elastic bands around the butt were way too tight and cut halfway through my cheeks. It just didn't work for me. I wasn't confident that a L would work because it would have been too big around, so I just returned it."
Autumn,"Amazing swimsuit for the price. I am very large chested and usually have to spend an incredible amount to feel secure. I took this swimsuit on a beach vacation with my family and did not feel uncomfortable once. Additionally, I am 5'11"", and the size medium fit great. It is also extremely flattering. The ""tummy control"" lends a very cute look to the waistline, and the amount of cleavage is perfect. I was very happy with my purchase. The only problem was that I got a small hole in the meshing of the back on the first wear, I must have snagged it or something. But, the hole did not grow at all during subsequent wears."
B. Sanders,"I normally do not buy one piece suits; I just don like them.  My friend had this suit and it looked fantastic on her so I thought Igive it a try.  I am 56, 140 lbs and a 34DD, usually size 8 and I ordered this suit in a medium.  This suit looks and fits great!  I was so surprised!  I feel that it has good support uptop and some ruching to help disguise my tummy issues.  Color has held up fine in chlorine pools so far.  So happy I took a chance on this suit!"
Lauren H.,"I definitely recommend this suit! Awesome purchase for the price! I ordered the XL and love it. I normally a size 14 in clothes. For reference I 50, 165 lbs and wear a 38H bra. I was really worried this couldn support me enough and I was really surprised! If it weren for my bust I probably would have ordered the 14 for a little more compression on my belly. But overall I very happy with the fit. Don pass up on this one!"
BJP in Cincy,very strange fit.  because of the closure around the neck it is sewn very narrowly making a tight fit to get over your hips unless you are quite small.
KDF,"I'm really unhappy with my body these days.  I'm a 16/short torso/apple/C-section belly and I have a horrible time with bathing suits.  I also historically don't have much luck with Amazon clothes.I'm telling you my stats, something I never do in hopes that I can help someone else like me because this bathing suit makes me feel GOOD.  Like, no body hate - just happy and comfortable.  Based on other reviews I did size up to the 14w and it's perfect and comfortable and everything is where it belongs and I honestly just love it.  I can't remember the last time before this that I loved a bathing suit.I do wish the fabric was a little thicker as I'm worried it won't hold up forever but for now, it's just great."
Tyler Hutchins,"I love almost everything about this suit! It super flattering in the front. I wish it had a tad more booty coverage. I usually wear a large for my chest and booty, and while the large does fit, I feel like I in between L and XL. I sticking with the L because the straps and front fit very well. Not sure if going up a size would give me the coverage I looking for in the booty. 57 and 160 lbs"
A. Smith,"I ordered this suit simply because of all the reviews it had and my need for more bathing suits in general! I was not disappointed! You couldn't get this swimsuit for the price at any other store locally. It's great quality and very flattering. I am a 38DD and typically wear a 12/14 dress size. I ordered a 1X knowing that most bathing suits are a bit on the tight side and this fits perfectly! It's comfortable and not too revealing, but also not too conservative either! I may order another color too!"
prezofxms,"I bought this swimsuit to wear in the middle of my pregnancy.  It was very flattering and camouflaged my expanding belly very well. It probably helped that I got it in navy blue.  The swimsuit doesn't have a lot of support if you have a large cup size.  I'm a DD, and it could have been more supportive and more roomy.  I've washed it a few times now, and it still looks brand new.  It is very low cut, probably more low cut than the photos indicate, and will show off plenty of cleavage.  The neckline is really high, so while swimming, it did dig a little bit into my neck.  Nothing too bothersome.  The back has plenty of coverage for your bottom too, which was nice!"
jody,"No breast support at all, not even a shelf bra! Also has moveable (not removable) cup liners which make your breasts look deformed. Too bad, because super cute swimsuit style otherwise."
Kindle Customer,"I read HUNDREDS of reviews on this bathing suit because, like most people, I hate buying things online. I'm not a model size, nor do I have a chest that I can walk into Victoria Secret with either.This bathing suit fits awesome, I bought a large (measurements are below). I was hoping the stomach area would pull in a little more but I didn't want to chance it with my bust on a medium. But after seeing where everything aligned, I might just try it for sh*ts and giggles.I'm 5'3, 175lbs with a 38F bust.This bathing suit saved my summer life. I bought the deep purple one, the color was beautiful. The mesh was extremely cute and a little sexy. Highly recommend!"
Elizabeth Mosier,I purchased the small and medium but both were too short length wise..... I am 5'9'' and 140 lbs...... I do have a long torso and I decided to take the plunge and order these suits.... I ordered both small and medium because I couldn't decide which one would fit best.... I got them both in the mail today and unfortunately needing to return both since they don't fit.  I do have a long torso so if you are questioning it and on the taller side I would suggest keep hunting for another suit.
Ashleigh Barber,"What a bargain! This suit fits better than many of my bathing suits that cost over $100! It is comfortable and fits everywhere well. I have nurses three babies and it even holds my boobies in a good position. The wine red color is very nice. I love that I don feel hoochy but still attractive and can still play with my kids without a nip slip or being self conscious of my mummy tummy. FYI - I 58, 183 lbs and wearing an XL."
Amazon Customer,"Description does not mention height (that I could find).  I am 5'8"", a tad too tall for most  one piece swimsuits (and too short for long torso suits); this fits, and comfortably, BUT the neck is definitely lower on me than on any of the models shown.  It still looks nice, and is very wearable, but it is not nearly as high as I'd hoped.  Also, it has pads, which are round, and which lump and bump oddly in the suit.  I plan to take them out.  They likely could be replaced with different pads, if someone wanted...but, if it matters to anyone, there is no hidden underwire or shelf bra, so no ""boost"".  The waist is a tad looser than I expected, but still looks good.  I'd prefer higher leg openings, but was aware the cut was low upon purchase.  All that said, this actually is a very flattering suit; I plan to lose a few pounds soon, and while I doubt I will wear a one piece often, there are occasions where a flattering one piece is nice to have, and I like this one enough that I plan to order a smaller one, when this one does not fit any longer.  While there are things I'd change about the suit if I could, it looks better than any one piece I have ever tried on."
J May Chag,"This bathing suit is adorable, and the fit is exactly as expected, but the mesh is ripped at the seam along one side. About 2 inches of it are torn. Definitely lacking quality control. As much as I love its design, I have to return it."
pancakes!,"I was hesitant to get a small but it fits well, maybe just a tad snug. A medium would be loose- and even looser in water- so I sticking with the small (plus I have 5 lbs. that I working on losing). I got it in Purple (on sale for $16.99!!). For reference I 52, 125 lbs., 34D. I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of support this bathing suit gives. So happy with this purchase!!"
Tonya S.,This swimsuit had a HORRIBLE smell straight out of the bag. It fit everywhere but the chest area. This is not for large breasted ladies. Very cheaply made. It felt and sounded like it was ripping at the seams when I tried it on. Will be returning.
Emily Huston,"Had ordered large, but with my long torso I returned and bought an XL. (5'9"")  For my large chest I had to take to padding out because they were made for As, not DDD, but nice coverage and still feel support by the swimsuit overall. It's my first one piece since I was 4, I've just had too long a torso. But I'm happy, it's sexy, but not inappropriate"
Denise,"I was looking for a flattering suit that I can wear while taking my kids swimming. I needed something secure so everything stays put while in the water with a grabby baby and toddler. This fits the bill perfectly. The cut is attractive and doesn't make you feel like you are hiding under a ""mom"" suit, it flaunts and flatters your curves and holds things nicely in place so you can feel confident and not have to constantly be checking and tugging at necklines. If you have a long torso or large bust, order up a size. I am 5'4"" 135lbs size small 4/6 and 32ddd. I ordered the small which looked great and gave good enough coverage in the bust, but it pulled painfully at the shoulders and dug in at the neckline. I exchanged for a medium which fit comfortably. I have an average to slightly long torso  and in combination with a larger cup size, I needed the extra length of the medium."
Leslie Robbins,"Very flattering. I 56 @ 235 lbs and purchased a 16W which was on the large size for my wide hip pear shaped frame. 14W or 16 would have fit better, but kept item and wore all 5 days on Hawaii trip and loved it!Very comfortable. Provided full coverage in the bottom area, never climbed in rear. Love the back mesh - it disguised any rolls I had and was very flattering. Front was very sexy without being too revealing. Did not experience any pinched underarm skin like Ie gotten with other suits around the arm pit area.Was able to play and have our two toddler aged  children climb all over me without having to make adjustments or worry about them pulling a string, or undoing the suit.I purchased board shorts to wear with this suit, but never wore them as I felt comfortable with the coverage in the back, front and leg that it wasn necessary. The style and cut was flattering enough I felt comfortable enough to go without the shorts."
MTFF,"Lovely colour, fits nicely. I am 5'8"" 140lbs, usually wear a size 6 but I have a big bust and a LONG torso so I have to size up significantly in bathing suits so I don't get cut in half. I bought the large and it fit really nicely. It was plenty long enough, maybe even a little roomy on the top which is not a bad thing because who wants squished boobies? My kids thought it was really nice and my husband loves it. I haven't had it for long enough to comment on how long it's going to last but for an upcoming getaway I'm really pleased with it"
Peg,"First off, the suit does not look bad on, but it does not look as people expressed. However, there is NO support whatsoever. There is a second lining on the top, that is it (and two useless nipple pads that slide everywhere). Most suits have a least a shelf with elastic under the bust line. This does not. Also, the elastic on the legs is HUGE. I always have to go up 4 sizes for my chest. I have never had a problem with the leg elastic being excessively large until now. I was really hoping this suit would work, but the legs would need to be taken in, I would have to add a shelf for the bust line and it is way too long from bust to top. Oh, and good luck with the hook at the neck. The opening is so small it is nearly impossible to put the fabric in. I had my daughter hook it for me, and even she struggled, yet it came flying off anyways."
Chey,"Love this swimsuit. I brought it on my recent vacation to wear to the beach and I received many compliments. It fit my body perfectly. Reading all the positive reviews here on Amazon from girls who have bodies like mine is what led me to purchase it! And I glad I did. I got the navy blue one and I love it.For reference, I am 54 and 158 lbs, so I got a size large! I like that this specific one piece can be conservative, yet still sexy at the same time because of the neckline. Highly recommend!"
Molly,"I have never purchased a swimsuit online before because it's so difficult to find a swimsuit that fits right and covers problem areas.  Since this got so many good reviews, and it's returnable I ordered it.  Love it! I'm actually surprised, I feel comfortable in it but also still sexy.  It's slimming.  I am 5ft 4in, 145 lbs and usually wear a medium.  I ordered a large, it's just a bit too big but i'm keeping it and when I order another (which I will) I will get the medium to compare the size.  So happy with this swimsuit!"
D.Stel,"I usually don't like one piece swimsuits, but I saw this on an article off of Facebook and have an upcoming vacation so I figured I would give it a try.I put it on and for a one piece it's less old lady than I expected. I don't think I'll see any grandma's doing water aerobics in this suit.The only thing I didn't like about this suit is the cups seemed a little off. They don't seem like they're in the right place, but I should be able to adjust them.At 170 lbs I don't always feel comfortable in a swimsuit - but this one isn't too bad. It should look great on my vacation.The middle is ruched so it helps disguise imperfections. The V-Neck adds a little sexiness to it without having the girls busting out like some other swimsuits at popular/big name lingerie stores."
Clover5,"I really liked how the suit looked on the pictures and even after reading some reviews that said there are problems with cups in the bra I decided to give it a try. While I am a fat girl I don't have very big breasts and this suit fit perfect! It is very comfortable and looks very flattering - I feel covered up but not like an old lady due to the see through elements. Also my boobs look pretty good in this style too! I think if you have larger breasts there will be more cleavage visible in the seethrough bit and maybe that's when the placement of the cups becomes an issue, but for smaller breasted ladies I really recommend you try it out! Also the red color is very very nice, can't wait to wear this this summer!"
Kate,"Loving this new suit. I am a 12 bottom, medium/large top and got the large (12-14). The suit fits perfectly through the top and waist and is snug, but not overly so, through the hips. I feel like it might be a little too snug if I was a 14.  The bottom does a nice job smoothing out my stomach and the top is really flattering."
Hannah,"Ie been rocking the same bathing suit for the last couple of years lol so I decided to get something more fashionable and fun. I only wear one pieces because I just not comfortable enough for bikinis though bikinis can have the cutest designs! This one piece definitely meets that criteria for me (it sexy ), but also it really establishes my body well. I 56 170 lbs a lil thick but because it black and has a design that sort of masks that. Based on other reviews I went for an XL, when I usually wear mediums. I glad I did because it just the perfect fit. My only issue is it small in the back so if I went for a large it would ride up. To be safe go a size or two up like I did. Anyways, great quality swimsuit will be perfect for this summer "
Christina,This swimsuit is extremely flattering. I still loosing weight from my pregnancy and this made me feel so confident. I 56 with 34DD and I ordered a large. I notmally around a size 10 but ordered up based on measurements and reviews and it fit very nicely. Very happy! It also has great support for large breasts.
Robin,The fit on the body is very flattering. However if you are particularly well endowed like me (38 G) there is spillage on the side or smashed boob in the middle. The neck also pulls down. However I am keeping it because it holds in my back fat and is one of the best suits I can find for lap swimming regardless of the flaws. I understand I in the minority with my chest size so it still gets 4 stars. At least I don have to worry about a boob popping out. #bigboobproblems
Janine Ann,"This is a perfect swim suit. I hate wearing swim wear but this one covers and hugs the right areas and still looks sexy and stylish. Love, and will buy again in other colors. I 59 long torso. Was perfect in the torso area. I usually wear 12-14 in pants and L/XL in tops. 38D. I bought the XL(US16) and it was perfect. I wouldn of gone any smaller or it would of been too tight. Also, the Navy is slightly darker than the photo."
Bugsy,"This suit fit really well, with a little sexy flare, went with a size M based on the size chart measurements and is exactly what I was looking for. BUT it came with a 2.5in hole where the binding wasn't sewn to the suit on the chest area. Can't be sewn so it's going back. Will order another and hopefully it will be fine.Update:Adding a star. Returned defective product and ordered/received my new one which was free of holes and fits well. Was contacted by the company after I had already completed the return process and received my new suit. They offered a coupon on another product which I don't need at this time but was nice to hear from them."
Kourtney R.,"I cannot rave enough about this swimsuit. I typically hate all swim suites on my body type, but this one is SO FLATTERING! Fits my 38DD chest extremely well and the swimsuit is very flattering on curvy hips. The material is excellent quality and I love the mesh on the front and the back. The blue color is a bit darker than the picture shows but I LOVE it. This is my new favorite swim suit and I would absolutely recommend."
Missy M.,"So first off, the style is adorable and the quality is spot on. Did not feel cheap at all. I would say that the size does run a tad bit small, but for me it wasn a show stopper. However...the coverage in the butt area is lacking. If youe going for a cheeky look (like half of your ass cheeks hanging out) then this look is for you. Unfortunately, I have zero ass, so this was not a very flattering look for me, but honestly I think that fit might be too tight for anyone down there. I 52 and 110lbs, pretty much short in all departments and the suit felt a little short on me.I begrudgingly returned it because it was just not flattering on me, which sucks because it truly is a cute suit."
Ms V in MD,"WOW, really says it all! I LOVE THIS BATHING SUIT. I 56, run 165-170lbs, 38DD & a size 10 in pants, L in tops. I measured top shoulder to bottom butt cheek & got 25. I consider myself long waisted, dresses are a pain. This bathing suit fits me great in the XL. This suit could stand an inch more for cheek coverage like my Vanity Fair briefs but this fit is okay for me for sun wear & swimming/wadding.  I bought the L & XL but will replace the L with an XL in another color for comfort around the neck/shoulder closure. The fabric & stitching are wonderful to touch & see. The shear parts have a stretch to it but but I can see where a too small top for the girls would wear shearing out in time. The XL suits my girls size. I just hope it lasts through its intended uses, family fun!"
Megan H,"I LOVE this suit!!!!! I haven worn a swimsuit in years. Couldn even tell you the last time. I took a chance on this one before going on a cruise. It is perfect! I still wear shorts over the top, but it still super cute and sooo comfortable! I keepMeaning to get another one in another color, just waiting until it a little closer to swimming time!  But this is so flattering. Best suit Ie found in years! I 57 and 138lbs. The medium fit perfectly!"
Erika V,"Ie ordered a lot of swim suits from amazon and this is the only one Ie kept. The butt part is not too cheeky but also not fully covered like I 80 years old. Perfect amount of coverage. The chest part is just sheer enough for a bit of sexy cleavage but doesn make me feel inappropriate. The material is great. For reference, I am 145 lbs, 55 and have a 34DD chest and I ordered a medium. It hard to find a suit for bigger chests that don leave you hanging out. This is the one! I love this suit!"
mWit,"I cannot rave about how much I love this swimsuit! I have been on a search for a cute one piece for when my kids and I are at the pool with their friends and family and I am soooo happy I found this.I purchased an xsmall and it fits my petite frame perfectly (5'3"" / 95lbs). The laced part on the front and the opening in the back gives it a little sexiness without over kill. I love the way the fabric lays across the stomach area. The fabric is soft, comfortable and dries quickly upon exiting the water. The color is absolutely gorgeous. I am very pale and I love how the color doesn't wash me out. Not too dark not too light.Absolutely recommend you to try it!"
Carla,This suit is super cute but fits on the small side. I would order a size or two up. I hope to return and replace it for a size that fits. The quality seems to be fine and the design is well thought out for women who want to hide their belly but still be sexy! This seller has great customer service.
misssillylily,"Super cute suit! I originally purchased a large but returned it for a medium. (I 53, 145lbs and 36DD.) Based on my chest size, and from reading previous reviews, I had ordered a large but overall the suit was just too big. The medium fits so much better; it a little more revealing in the cleavage but that just me not being used to a plunging neckline. The suit itself is very flattering and a great value. Idefinitely say order your regular size."
Alicia marker,I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally would based on the reviews that I read and the suit still doesn't fit. I am also upset that I did not find out in time to return the item as I was on vacation and now I am stuck with a swimsuit that doesn't fit. You should at least allow for Amazon credit or something if it is after 30 days. very unhappy Amazon customer right now!!
Chubby Canine,"Before I start, let me just say, BUY THIS! I can't say enough good things about this! Definitely exceeded my expectations, especially chancing ordering a bathing suit online vs. trying it on in store. I am SO picky and self conscious when swimsuit shopping comes around, but this year will be different. Very very flattering IMO, hides my problem areas making me feel much more confident and comfortable. I actually can't wait to wear it out in public! I am a size m/l in shirts, size 12 in jeans and a 36d. Based on other reviews I read, I ordered up a size getting the XL. Could have gone with a large but I like the little bit of extra room I have :)"
shopee,"Fit a little tighter than expected. But still all good. I ordered size medium and I am 5'7 150 lbs. Butt isnt hanging out, tastefully covered but still cute. I needed a swim suit I felt comfy being in front of my dad and brother in but my husband would still find attractive on our family vacay. Doesn't get any more perfect! Back is so sexy but beware getting it too tight as it does push into my face flab a bit but I'm sure I'm the only one that will notice or care. Definitely worth the price! Highly recommended"
Amazon Customer,"I was so skeptical that a suit could really be that good, but I'm a believer. Now... that said, I haven't worn it in water :) I'm 5'8 170ish lbs and bought a large. It was a little tight to get over my hips, but once I got it on it fit perfect. It's classy without being trashy and I'm confident my kids won't pull it off me. There are built in cups that are a lot better than other suits I've bought on amazon :) I want it in another color now :)"
Puffinboat,"I'd say the most disappointed I have been of any swimsuit that I have ever bought.  I swim laps daily and this suit definitely is not made for that. The bottom was as if there was no elastic in it and hung loose. All my other suits fit perfectly in a size 12 (I am 5'4, 135 pounds). I could have returned this one to see if a size 10 would be better but it would still have the loose legs and the fabric feels nothing like the firm fabrics of quality suits that I have owned for years. Dont waste your time or money. Can't believe it has been hyped as the most popular bathing suit sold by Amazon."
Amazon Customer,"I ordered a variety of suits on amazon and this was the one I kept.  I loved the fit.  (size 16W-fits true to size)  I am pear shaped and plus size.  This suit was very flattering and comfortable while still having sex appeal.  It has molded cups in the top which really don't offer support if you have a large bust, but for me they were enough to shape me that I was happy.  Unfortunately, after having all of these good things to say about this suit, when I wore it for the first time Memorial Day Weekend, the fabric (black) bled all over my skin.  I am sad that now I have to go through the process of finding another suit for summer :("
A. Lawrence,Got this suit in yellow and I LOVE it!!! It was perfect for a trip to Miami this summer. Sexy without being too revealing. I went with a 16plus which fit great out of the box but found it was a bit loose in the bottom after it got wet. I was a little worried that it would leave wonky tan lines but after a full day in Florida sun I found tan lines to be minimal.  I HIGHLY recommend this suit! I have spent double the money on suits from retailers advertising plus sized swimwear and found this one to be on par if not better! It has been years since I was this excited about a swimsuit and will probably buy it in another color as well.
Kayla Michalik,"Ok, so I haven gone swimming in it yet but I rushed to write a review because I put it on and it incredible.I 56, 198 pounds and wear size 14 jeans comfortably. I bought the XL. I have a little extra trank in the trunk and I not comfortable showing my lower body so this is my first real swimsuit since I was a young teenager. I put this suit on and feel incredible. My chest looks amazing, the cut of the back is so flattering and lays nice and flat. The rouching (sp) of the sides is so beautiful and it makes what I would call my belly rolls look smooth also.It an amazing suit!"
obnerd1234,"I was looking for something a tad bit more conservative than suits I normally wear and this is great! Color is exactly the same the picture, so is the sheer. Fit as expected, the size charts are good. I wear a size 12 jeans and can fit dresses 10-14; waist is 33in, hips 43in, and I'm a 38B.....I got the ""OX (Size 14 Plus)"" and it fit perfectly. Did not pull or pinch anywhere and the back fastener is quite secure. Highly recommend."
Melody,"I am 58.5, and anywhere between 160-170 depending on my current food habits. This suit fits ok  a bit loose for my standards but I would NOT size down because it already pretty cheeky on me in the back. I prefer a more fitted suit since some tend to sag over time, but the cut makes it so I can size down. The fabric is most definitely cheap, as well as the stitching, but it looks like itl last for casual use for at least a season, maybe two if youe gentle with it. For the price, I say it a great find! Will buy a higher quality suit next time though."
Taylorlr2,This suit is just universal. It holds you in all the right spots and covers where it needs to. It also flattering on so many body types. My one dissatisfaction(and to only have one with a swimsuit and post baby body is a miracle) is that the leg holes are a bit tight but Il probably wear shorts with it anyway since I hate bending over without more coverage.
Amazon Customer,"I returned 3 other swimsuits before trying this one so I was doubtful that it would look good but decided to give it a try after all the rave reviews. Everyone was right! It's fantastic. Good coverage but still sexy. I got the navy which is more of a true navy than what is shown in the pictures. I am 5'4"" about 125 pounds, 34B cup, and the small fit wonderfully. The ruching across the stomach is great to hide my little mom pooch. I'm excited to wear it on my beach trip in a few weeks. If you're thinking about trying it, go for it!"
Victoria,"If I could write a hundred positive reviews about this suit I would. I'm 5'11"" and normally, one-pieces and I do not get along due to my long torso. This suit fits like a dream. I ordered the XL and it clasped easily and comfortably. After wearing it out all day at the pool, I didn't get the straps digging into my shoulders like I usually do. The mesh panels give it just the right amount of style. 10/10 recommend."
Karen S,"I just received this suit and couldn wait to try it on. It is so flattering and comfortable at the same time. Great coverage, but still sexy.  I usually wear a size 2 in clothing, but a 4 in swimwear. Since I wasn familiar with the brand, I ordered an XS and a S. I keeping the S, which is what I would have picked based on the size chart, so I would say it runs true to size. It easy to get on and off too, which you can say for a lot of suits.  I can comment on how well it will hold up over time, but it seems well made.  I definitely would recommend this suit."
LilCox,"This suit is gorgeous. I haven bought or worn a swimsuit in 14 years(I 27). Super self conscience. I 57 and 220lbs. I ordered the large and it fits perfectly. I have a long torso and long legs and it isn short on me at all and covers my butt. I plan on wearing this to the local pool with my kids. I wanted something I felt comfortable in without it being too much, like a dress/skirt style suit would. Currently losing weight and I think this will continue to fit nicely as I go."
Kaylinn,"I sure this suit is exactly what some people are looking for, but it was a little off for me. Felt just a smidge short overall, the boob inserts weren quite right, and the butt was way cheeky for what I was looking for. It came quickly though, the color was fantastic, and the material/quality seems to be what I expected. For reference, I a 34D, 55 and about 175 lbs right now (Ie always been curvy, just have more of a belly than Ilike at the moment). I do think the style is very cute and could definitely look great on people."
Nana,"I usually don't write reviews but I hope this will help others looking at this swim suite. I am 5'7"" around 150/155 lbs, 34B cups. Pear shaped body. This looked great. And it seems that the quality is good. Not tight around tights.However the thing around the neck if pretty tight. I couldn't wear it. I don't have a long torso as some other reviewers complained but it was still tight. If you are OK with it and love having something right around your neck then go for it. But if you don't I wouldn't recommend it. It seems at least in my case to put pressure right around collar bone and that little indentation in the middle. It was very unpleasant."
ALM19,"This bathing suit hides all of my insecurities!!! It flattering on the waste line, covers back fat, and most importantly does NOT give you those little fat roles by your breasts/armpits! The bathing suit is sexy and comfortable and very practical. I normally wear a large - I ordered an XL and it perfect."
peajay star,"Although the quality of the material and the design of this suit are a great deal for the price, mine is huge.  I ordered a 1X which I based on the reviews I read.  The box it came in was destroyed by the carrier leaving it out in the pouring rain.  Thank goodness the product was in a zippered plastic bag and protected from the elements.  I have nothing to put this in to send it back to get a smaller size and the paperwork in the damaged box was also a wet pile of mush, so I am going to put it in the washer and dryer and hope it shrinks."
Shawna,"I am 5 ft 8 and weigh around 175 lbs with most the weight being around the middle..I am long legged and somewhat long torso..with that being said, this suit looked amazing on!! I am smaller chested and worried that maybe the top would fit properly (compared to the pic) but it worked!  You can see slight cleavage, so larger busted ladies it will show more..the back was very flattering and this whole suit was just super! I have ordered around 10+ suits trying to find something that made me look decent and this one is by far my favorite!!!"
GiGi,"Since I am 5'4, 194 lbs with protruding belly always tend to go for the black bathing suit to minimize all over.  This time I wanted something black but not the old usual plain black.  This one is not only slimming but the design is quite cute and sexy. I Usually wear 1X on tops and 16 on bottoms. I ordered the XL and fits perfect.  I really, really LIKE IT!"
Katie Kirks,"First swimsuit Ie had in a long time that was both flattering and comfortable. Blue is actually navy blue, which is what I was hoping for after reading other reviews that said the same. For reference, I 54, 140-45lbs, small C cup. I have a bit of a tummy post pregnancy, and with the scrunchy part around the waist, it hides it really well. Not tight enough to call it tummy control per se, but very flattering. I feel classy and pretty and comfortable all at the same time, definitely recommend."
doomandgloom,"The bathing suit was cute, but I returned it because there was a hole (see photos). There not great support, but I would have kept the suit if it didn have a hole. Flattering and comfortable."
Kristin Higgs,"I love the suit but sizing is way off. It fits great for the most part except the bum. Minimal coverage there. I normally wear a size medium (8) but got a large because of the reviews. I am 56, 155lbs 36D with an athletic build. It just fits but doesn cover my flat bum. I have average hips. That will require frequent adjusting I predict. Fits great on the top. Great for larger busted woman. I will keep it and see how it wears. Great suit for the price!! Definitely size up."
Always looking for a bargain,"This suit really does live up to the hype. I bought it in black. The style really is flattering for my 57, 40C chest, 238 pound body.  Ie been wearing swim dresses for the past couple of years because I don feel comfortable with the way my legs look in regular suits. While I still self conscious about my inner thighs, this suit fits very nicely and the style is very flattering. I would be comfortable walking around the pool in it.  I looking forward to packing this for my Kauai vacation in August."
Amazon Customer,"Just wanted to give a quick review for any fellow long torso ladies. If youe one of those girls who had to buy tunic length tops to cover your waist, then I happy to report this should be fine for you. I not tall at all, but I ridiculously long in the torso and have needed 2 piece swimsuits since I was 15 just because I can get a one piece to fit. I took a chance on this and it does fit me! There is some pressure on my shoulder straps but I can tell if it because I need to lose another 15 lbs or if it just at the edge of fitting my torso. It does not ride up at all, so I leaning toward just being a snugger fit due to my weight. I don have the ruching as much, which could be a combo of my torso length and thicker waist line, but it still looks nice. I ordered a large since I actively dieting and anticipate some weight loss by summer, so it should fit even better in a couple months. I 54 (and approx 65 inch torso- based on a guide to measure torso for swimsuits), and approx 165 lbs with a small bust."
Ola Beavz,"I'm 5'9, I bought a L and an XL.  Both were too short.  I love the way it sucked me in and it was ALMOST correct, if it had had an extra inch in length.If you're shorter, its very flattering.  If you're tall, it'll make you sad to have to return, because it really is very flattering...but pulls a LOT on the neck."
Katie Kasprzak,IT DISINTEGRATED IN THE POOL WHILE I WAS WEARING IT AND WAS SEE THROUGH BY THE TIME I GOT OUT. HUMILIATING AND THIS BATHING SUIT IS SO CHEAP
TennisStar,"I originally ordered this swimsuit based on the number size, but that was a mistake. If you are a Medium, order a medium and disregard the number sizes. I originally ordered the Small because it correlated with size 6, but that is not correct, or maybe I am heavier than I realized, lol. The small was tighter around the neck and dug into me around the thighs. The medium fit perfectly The bathing suit is super cute and slimming! I think it is pretty durable as I wore it everyday, for six days while I was on vacation. I recommend the bathing suit, but order based on your letter size and not number size."
KTWILD,"I am 5 7 and 160 lb. I have a very small chest 36A or 34B and very big butt and thighs. I am in anywhere from size 8 to size 12 jeans depending on the style.  I have 1 year old triplets and needed a swimsuit for my new mom body. I ordered the medium, and it fits great everywhere. The ruching helps hide the post baby pooch. It has nice hiney coverage. And I feel like it will stay pretty secure with the boys hanging on me in the swimming pool."
Amazon Customer,"I ordered this swimsuit knowing it wasn't for tall people and knowing it would run small. I usually wear a S/M so I ordered a L, and I love the swimsuit and I am keeping it, however it shows a whole lot of booty because I am 5'8. also as others mention this isn't the swimsuit for you if you need support in the chest area. But this swimsuit is what I was looking for since I wanted a lot of coverage up top, and I ordered board shorts to wear with it, so buttcheek problem solved! Overall it is cute and if they made one for people with a longer torso I'd buy it again ;)"
Andmic510,"I loved the style of this swimsuit. Not bad for support on top. Love how the back hides any back fat you may have. The suit fit well except it was too short length wise. So it felt a bit like Ibe tugging at it nonstop while wearing and straining my neck in the process. For reference, I 57. 165 lb.43-33-43. Size 10-12. I ordered an XL."
mirabilys,"I'm 174 pounds with a 38G chest and ordered the 16 Plus. Chest area doesn't remotely cover and no support at all. Also really don't like how the hip area is cut - like a high cut panty. Really not flattering for plus size at all. Overall the size is too big for me, yes, but the suit is also just cut so that I won't like a smaller size that may fit better. Returning."
Christine Pfusch,"Exactly as pictured. The quality was wonderful. I felt so sexy in this it's insane. I have a smaller chest for my build and it made them look really nice. Wasn't too tight, wasn't too lose. The only uncomfortable thing was the strap around the neck...But after wearing it for a while you don't notice it. I highly recommend this suit to anyone in the market for a new one."
Danielle D.,"I had a baby two months ago and need a suit for an upcoming trip. I tried suits from JCrew, Summersault, you name it. Being 5'10'' and still holding baby weight I was having a really hard time.  I got this 2 based off of the reviews and I'm so happy I did. it was the only suit that didn't make me feel like a gigantic beached whale. It was long enough to fit my long torso, compression enough to make me feel like I was smooth, enough of a style to make it not feel like a mom suit..."
Marcelle Antunes,"I recently watched a Youtube review video of Amazon swimsuits by Sarah Rae Vargas and didn't think much of it until I saw how flattering so many of the suits looked on curvier, larger women! I was majorly impressed and thought I'd try my luck, not really 100% sure it would be as good as it was made out to be. I also braved a colour that people haven't picked before (or at least in review photos) so was extra nervous, but honestly, it's just a stunning and flattering as the Youtube review and the comments here have described! I'm on the size 12/14 and sometimes 16 (with big thighs and hips but smaller top half)  so I opted for an L and that suited my shape just right.  The mesh on the chest part is a lovely look! As mentioned, I'm not as blessed up top as I am on the bottom (I'm a 34D)  so it feels a *little* roomy but honestly, it's very minimal and once the back is all tightened up, it's still flattering and not awkward. The material feels great, the yellow is a gorgeous mustard colour which works great with my skin tone and isn't tacky looking at all. One of the most impressive bits was how FAST delivery was! I'm based in the UK and was concerned it would take months to get to me but it was here in about two weeks! For international shipping from the States, was just a real treat! I'll be taking this to my next holiday to Greece and am really excited to wear it. I'm very tempted to buy the deep red one also!Ps: Please ignore the mess in the photos was mid spring cleaning when I decided to try this swimsuit on, ha!"
Marvelynn,"Im 5 9, about 175 lbs. 34DDD.Large fits PERFECT. I usually have a huuuge issue finding 1 pieces that are both tall enough for my long torso, and supportive enough in the top.This does both!Only reason for 4 instead of five stars, it doesnt suck in the tummy as much as i wouldve liked(rouching is flattering tho) and the back is not lined. Ill prolly end up lining it myself, just so it doesnt get stretched out and thin."
Candy,I really like the color of the red swimsuit that I ordered and it seems to be sewn together properly.  My only complaint is that on the panty line in the back it doesn have as much coverage as I woulde preferred. I can tell that I going to constantly have to be adjusting the swimsuit when I wearing it. Other than that I really like it. It didn come with any holes like some of the other customers had gotten. I think I just might have to get used to wearing a sarong with it
Mommyx2,This suit was not nearly long enough. I'm 5' 7" amd would need 4 to 5 more inches in length on this suit.
KellyH,I ordered this bathing suit because of the price and the great reviews and I wasn disappointed!! It fits perfectly and it very flattering! I around 53 and 120lbs and ordered the small in the purple color. The color looks great and matches the pictures exactly. I haven tried it out in water yet so as long as it hold up this is a 5-star product!
mama of 3,"This was a beautiful suit the only problem was it fits very small. I wear a 36B and the top fit me perfectly. The bottom was too small for sure! The middle/belly part of the suit was tight but held everything in nicely. The neck line was too tight and uncomfortable. I ordered a size large and probably needed an XL but then it may have been too big in the chest area. I'm 5'4 and about 170lb with a mommy tummy. Really liked the quality, wish the fit was better. I had to return it."
Mom to 3,"Beautiful bathingsuit, especially for the price! I am 56 164lbs. Typically wear a size large and in jeans 12/14. I ordered the large according to the size chart. I do wish I ordered up. It fits, but a little too snug. I will keep this size as I am in the process of losing some baby weight, but if I were to order again it would have been an XL. The padding is a little wrinkled so it makes the boob area look a bit dimpled, but I think with wear that will smooth out. All in all I am happy with this suit, the cut is pretty and the sheer panel in the front makes me feel pretty, yet covered!"
Tara A.,This is a really nice swimsuit. The material is what youexpect from high quality swimwear. I trusted the reviews that reported the sizing to be small and ordered an xxl. I normally wear a l/xl or a 12 or 14. The tag on the suit wasn sized xxl; it said 16W. It was too big. It was baggy in the chest and loose around my waist and butt. I would say that it is sized very accurately and will likely order another in a large.
Jenny,"I honestly can decide if I love it or hate it. I think it more of the color that I don like. But I also not used to it, I always get black this time I got the red.The only thing I really don like about this suit, is that the cups for the boobs are very noticeable. They make you look like you have a huge Ariola. I will be cutting those out. If youe bigger chested there is no support in this suit. I like it well enough to wear it in Vegas."
linda,looks good and fits really nicely. the neck is strongly tight. I have a petite upper body so this would not fit someone with a long torso for sure. I had to go up a size and the neck still kind of pulls. but otherwise it's comfortable and looks great.
Christina,"Fits amazing! Makes me feel so confident! Exactly what I was looking for.UPDATE: finally was able to wear continuously on my cruise this past month for 2 weeks. After wearing a few times, It seems like materIal started to deteriorate at my lower back area and a few spots around the sides. It very odd like the material in those spots became see though but just certain patch areas. Thankfully I had a back up suit. I very disappointed because I loved this suits fit. Now it trash after one trip."
ashleyrenee,Looking for a swimsuit to cover up seriously asymmetrical breast issue while breast feeding - this suit is very flattering and extremely helpful. The asymmetry isn't noticeable  in this suit (and it is absurdly so in every other suit I've tried on). It fits well and it made of nice material. We go to our community pool often and it's held up nicely this summer.Exactly as pictured.
tiredbiscuit,"I ordered two different suits last minute for a trip to Aruba, and thought this was going to be the one I hate but I actually loved it so much more!! It's so flattering, and very comfortable while affording me coverage where I want it but still able to get some SUN. It did however, leave a terribly odd tan line for the chest piece, as the sun also gets through the mesh even with a LOT of sunscreen. The straps around the shoulders also got uncomfortable on day 3 of a sunburn. Overall, I kept this suit and returned the other and was very happy."
Mollly,"I like this swimsuit because its classy at the top and flattering to the bust, with still some modesty. I normally wear a size L/XL in tops and size 12 pants. I purchased a L and XL and returned the L. I kept the XL because it had just a little more room for me! Hope this helps"
michelle,"I received this super quick! I absolutely love it. I'm 5'5"",140 lbs and a 34C and bought this in a large based upon the height (if I bought this in a medium it may actually cut me into my skin in my nether regions). I have a longer torso and one piece swim suits are a struggle. It's a little snug at the neckline but I'm okay with that, because I can actually go swimming in this swimsuit. The stomach area is very flattering and gives me even more of a flatter look. I have full coverage in my front and back region. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the bust. The cups are a little weird and my chest size doesn't fill out the top as the model shown fills out the bust area. But other then that, I totally recommend this swim suit and it's sexy looking on without looking to scandalous."
Kristy,"Super flattering and very cute!  It's trendy but I don't look like I am wearing a suit from the juniors section.  The high neck is really nice- I feel like I can move around without anything falling out!  The only thing is the booty is a little bit smaller than I was hoping for.  I ordered the next size up to see if it would help, but then the whole suit was too big.  I will for sure keep this suit, but maybe wear a sarong when I am out of the pool."
Sarah,"I am so disappointed. When I received this I immediately tried it on and loved the look of it and the way it made me feel. I took it off and hung it up. I just wore it to the pool for the first time yesterday. I wore it for maybe an hour and a half just floating in the pool. After just ONE wear, the nylon material in the back has tears!! I thought this felt like a good quality bathing suit, but seeing it start ripping after one little use is extremely upsetting. Now I don have a bathing suit to wear. Bad quality!!"
Margaret 2012,"I was desperate to find a swimsuit that had a higher neck. the halter tops and skinny straps just don't cut it. this was perfect, I wore it to the pool yesterday and it was GREAT. didn't have to worry about making sure my top was pulled up or any wardrobe malfunctions, ha! I ordered a large, my typical size - and it fits just fine. I'm not one to order clothes online without knowing how they fit. I read lots of reviews for this suit, checked the sizing, and went for it. So glad i did, planning on buying another in a different color."
Victoria,I ordered the purple but it is more red or maroon. The cut on the hip is way higher than pictured and the top is narrow.
Chella43084,"Reaaaalllly love this bathing suit! I made the mistake of ordering too big a size so am returning for a smaller size. Even still, it felt comfortable, held me in at all of the right places and had great top support! It was very flattering in the stomach area, which was the reason for my purchase!"
louduva,"This bathing suit is AWESOME! so flattering, sexy but not inappropriate. Few notes, the bottom part is sized a little larger than the top, meaning that the top fits perfect on me while the leg holes and belly area feel a little loose but by no means anything noticeable to others.  Next, someone may have to help you button the neck, i couldnt do it by myself the first time i wore it, i was able to do it the second time with a little time but easier if someone else helps."
YankeeLuv22,I am always skeptical about buying clothing online because I afraid they won fit. This product did not disappoint. I 52 and a little over 200lbs and I got the 1x. I have a very big chest (36J/K) and finding things that fit up top can be a problem. If you are bigger chested you have to kind of play around with the girls to get them to stay put and above the little band in the front. My only complaint is that I have to cut out the pads they put in front of the breast (if you have a smaller chest you don have to worry about this). I wish they created a slot where you could just slide the pads out without having to cut into then re-sew the area (unless I missed the slots). With all that being said I love the bathing suit. I think the mesh area in front adds that sexy touch without it being gawdy or over the top. It the first bathing suit that Ie had in a while that I actually don feel self conscious in and enjoy wearing. Ie had this bathing suit for about 2 months now and have used it quite often and it still looks like I just pulled it out the bag. I also like that it comes with a wet bag for easy clean up after swimming.
D.P.,"This suit fits beautifully. When I saw so many other women's reviews and saw their photos, I knew this would be a great product-it fits so many different body shapes. I'm busty, and a size 12. Measurements: 42-34-40.The Large fit me just fine. I purchased this in black and also the red, which is a gorgeous, deep crimson color. Love them both!"
Michael,"36DD in the chest, about 160 lbs. I was worried about the chest support with this one being a little larger chested and it was PERFECT. Complimenting to your waist as well. Loved this."
AG,"I'm 5'2, 135lbs, 36C/D and ordered the Medium. I read a LOT of the other reviews trying to figure out what size I needed. Even with all of the rave reviews, I was still skeptical about a $25 off-brand bathing suit that I've never tried on. I avoid bathing suit shopping at all costs.  Seriously, I have one bathing suit that I think I bought 7-8yrs ago and even that one I am constantly pulling, pushing or tucking something back in. At 37yrs old, I need all the help I can get from my bathing suit!!The Tempt Me suit in the medium was a perfect fit! I couldn't believe how much I loved it!! I didn't think it was ""cheeky"" like some of the other reviews mentioned. It's not as ""ruched"" as I thought it would be, but it still has decent tummy coverage. I will say there is a SLIGHT gap in the side boob area, but who doesn't love a little side boob? : D  I'm hoping it holds together unlike some of the other reviews that mentioned it fell apart after wearing 4 times."
J&C99,"I originally ordered a large (I'm usually a large in most things). After trying on the large, it could have been fine but I wanted to see if a medium would offer a little more support in the stomach area. I am keeping the medium and returning the large. I haven't bought a one piece in a very long time. This one camouflages the stomach area which I love. Seemed to have also have pretty good support in the chest area, not 100% but way better than most suits I have tried."
dt,"I wasn't sure what to expect with buying a bathing suit off of Amazon. But I'm pretty impressed so far. I tried it on and the the bathing suit is super cute and sturdy. It runs a little small. I'm 5' 6"" and usually am a size 4 and so I bought the Small (that fits size 4-6). The small is already a snug fit for me, so if you are more of a size 6 I would recommended trying the Medium as well. Label says it's made in China. I haven't washed it yet, so will update if anything out of the ordinary happens."
sui generis,"I'm 5'9 and 148lbs, and despite the size chart recommending a size medium, I purchased a large due to my height, I'm glad I did, as even the large is still a little small length wise and cuts into my toosh more than I'd like from pulling up.  The XL would probably have been too big everywhere else though, so I'll stick with one size up. Super cute suit though! Love that I'm covered but still feel sexy."
Sue Clark,"The Malachite green is a deep teal, which is pretty . My normal size is between 10/12, and I chose the medium. Fit well, but don't expect any 'tummy control' or compression. Ruching on the abdomen disguises flaws, and the back minimizes back rolls. I am a C cup, and found adequate support in the bust area; not sure how bustier ladies may fare. Soft cups with a shelf-like bra. I don't regret buying this suit at all. It's very flattering, without showing too much."
CocoCream,"I have a 11 month old daughter and am self-conscious regarding my mom-bod. I didn't feel 100% confident in a two piece yet and wanted to find something that would make me feel good. I browsed on Buzzfeed and found this TemptMe swimsuit that boasted sexiness and coverage all at once. I was immediately attracted to this product and bought a size S (for reference: current weight 122, 5'1"", now wearing a size 6, 38C). I was apprehensive about the fit because most reviews said to order a size up but this was a great fit!"
Amazon Customer,I love this swimsuit!After losing 55lbs i needed a new swimsuit but didnt want to spend a fortune like i did on the last "plus-size" swimsuit at the mall since it wont fit me next summer. I followed the size chart provided in the description and the swimsuit fits perfect. Its super flattering (covers the back fat  and great quality for how inexpensive it was. It also showed up super fast.The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because coming out of the package it smells horribly of chemicals and Bengay and required a few washes before it came out.
Veronicad1,I haven't worn it in public yet but it fits lovely. I'm a large busted woman with a whole lot of curves going on - a few in places I would rather they weren't. This is an attractive suit and it makes me feel good when I put it on
Kat,"It's a great one-piece suit with some reveal. The mesh paneling from the neck across the cleavage is enough to be attractive but not to be sleazy or inappropriate. I like the light draping/layers that happen across the stomach area. It helps detract from anything that is too tight or clingy to the mid-section. I do feel it rides up a little in the back, but as long as you don't have a wedgie or make it into a thong, it's easy to handle. Overall I'm really happy with this suit and I'm glad I jumped on getting one when it was trending."
Christine Gist,"If you are NOT curvy or loaded with ample chest, do not buy.  The top was huge. A smaller breasted women does not need gathers at the BOTTOM AND TOP of the chest portion of the suit!  Made the gathers roll over the edge of the mesh, looked messy and like a cheap swimsuit.  The stitching was horrific.  Overall, I completely disappointed in the XS (34-26-34 51)suit.  Looks like they used a large top and crammed it on an xs suit.  I ordered it bc of the yellow color, Loved the color.  If you have curves and LOTS of them they might stretch out all the construction issues. Dark colors will also not show as many issues, the yellow was horrific.Otherwise it looks like a 10 year old was operating the serger."
Heathernheights,"I love love the fit of this suit! Supportive in the chest. Modest and sexy at the same time. I an 8/10 and ordered the medium. Fit as expected. I would give this suit 5 stars but on the first wash (machine wash, gentle cycle, cold water; hung to dry) some of the meshing is already starting to peel. If I could do it again, Isay to only hand wash. Hoping it holds up for a few more wears."
Amazon Customer,"I wanted to love this suit, but will be returning. (For reference, I'm about 175 lbs, 36DDD, 5'10"", size 12 pant) I ordered the size the size chart put me in (L), and a size up because I know swimsuits can be iffy. I couldn't get the recommended size over my hips. The size up (XL) was much better but... I'm top heavy and the girls were being smooshed out the sides. Maybe some people are into that, but I prefer feeling secured. Also, since I'm tall and swimsuit wedgies aren't really my thing. Add to that it was putting pressure on my neck/shoulders when fastened. I think if I could get it in a tall I'd be sold. All that being said, I'm 35, taken, and I'm more concerned with comfort than looking desirable to strangers the opposite sex, lol."
robin677,"Fell apart the first time I wore it, a week after return window closed. Do NOT buy."
PunkyBo,"I LOVE the style of this suit. The top is very flattering, the fabric is thick and it holds everything in, I love the shape and shearing through the waist, and the legs are not cut too high. However, it runs very small. I ordered a size up, and even still, this is really right across my rear. It fits everywhere else, but is very tight and doesn rides up/doesn fully cover in the back. I going to keep it because I don want to exchange and risk the next size up being too big on top, but the fit is a challenge to navigate, and that my main issue."
Cindi,"I do like this suit, the style, the cut, but its hard for me to find a one piece suit that fits, this one fits as i expected, to big in the top, but this one is a little to big in the bottom also. But I can deal with that. The biggest thing is the color, not at all what it showed on the picture. It showed almost a dark red and it is actually a tomato red. Not sure I going to keep it."
Alexus W.,"I had been going back and forth on whether to order this or not for a vacation to Hawaii with my boyfriend and his family. I am so glad I did! It's super flattering, sexy but still covers enough I won't feel uncomfortable wearing it around his parents and makes me feel like a million bucks. For reference I'm 5'2"" and 185lbs the ruching is just right and helps camouflage the belly which is where I carry most of my weight."
