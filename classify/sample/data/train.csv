SBN488,I wanted to love this suit SO BAD. I had to return it because it didn’t cover my butt. I am 5’6 and 158 pounds. Normally a size 10. I ordered a large. I have a long torso and typically struggle finding a one piece that’s long enough. This one was PERFECT in length. Super comfortable too. But I have been gifted on my backside and half my rear end hung out. Definitely doesn’t have full booty coverage If you have a butt. Unfortunately I have to return it. But I will say it was a fabulous suit and would probably work fantastic for any y’all woman with a small to normal sized rear end! :),-1,0,0,0
bpete,"The hype is real on this one. I normally do not let reviews convince me to try an item, but the photos of these moms totally won me over, bought this for myself and was elated when I tried it on. Worth it. I am 5' 5"" about 150lbs with a heavy booty that never fits into anything (and fairly large upper body with a tiny waist). Bought a size Medium. Was surprisingly perfect. I havent owned a swimsuit in ten years bc i cant stand wearing them, i am now looking for an excuse to wear this one because it feels wonderful and holds all my curves in place. TOTALLY WORTH IT! (just do not dry it, line dry!!)",1,0,0,0
Alyssa2016,"I haven’t actually worn this swimsuit yet but trying it on it looks great! I do wish the shear in the middle was a little more see through but that is no big deal. Also, it does run a little small but I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear and it fits perfect and looks great!I will update post after wearing a few times if there are any problems with the swimsuit.",-1,0,0,0
JNL,I am hoping this review reaches the company directly. I ordered this suit in a M in April and didn’t try it on until this weekend. Big mistake. I loved it but the butt portion did not fit me well. I ordered the size up in a different color and I love it! I’d love to exchange my first suit for the next size but my amazon return/exchange window has passed. My original suit still has all of the tags- I’d love the next size up in black.,-1,0,1,0
Erinn,"Cute suit. If you are well endowed, be advised that the bra cups are awkwardly small (but they are easily removed). Not entirely impressed with the elastic of the suit. It seems a bit stiff like it probably won't hold up long. If you have any back flab it will be noticable in this suit. I bought this because it was available for 2 day shipping and I needed a suit for a water park party. Overall it is a decent swimsuit for the price and has an appealing design that works well for a mom-bod without making me feel matronly.",-1,0,0,1
miricaniabesla,Very sexy but still modest at the same time. I know the description of this is crap due to their bigoted view of how a woman look after having children. You will just have to look past the way they have described it since they were probably using google translate anyways. The bottom line is this suit is great and fits as it should and most importantly makes you feel like a million bucks...not bad considering normally one would pay over a hundred for the same anywhere else.,0,0,0,1
Roxanne,"The swim suit is absolutely stunning on. It covers all my flawed areas. I got a size medium I’m 4’10” 120 lbs. 34dd. My only complaint is it looks like someone’s returned item. The bag and garment look worn. The garment was rolled up and thrown in the bag and the ziplock bag was all wrinkled. For as much as i love the garment, the thought of someone else’s return is unappealing, especially for a swimsuit. I will be ordering another (hopefully) new one in a different color.",1,-1,0,1
pg turner,"It seems weird that no matter what weight I am (currently I’m at my heaviest so I’m about a 38D), no money I spend gives me a suit that fits well after even one wear. So I was very skeptical about buying this given the price. But I read the reviews and knew it had an easy return and gave it a go. It’s beautiful! And fits me perfectly. I feel gorgeous in it, for a 40ish Mom. Don’t hesitate. It’s a great buy.",1,0,0,1
Kristy L.,"I never wear one piece suits. Ever. I’m only 5’5” bit have a long torso, so one pieces never fit right. I’m 41 with 4 children. Time for a one piece when we go to the pool with the kids. I’m a fit 5’5”, 120 lbs and the small fits great. Never have I liked a one piece so well. I just hope it holds up well.",1,0,0,0
Kristy Reed,"This suit fits perfectly.  It's sexy and modest, and makes me feel like I look amazing. I'm 5'1and 165lbs and love the way it fits. I would buy multiple colors of this but want different style suits (tankini) as well, so I'm limited to only one. Love the green color. Wash before you wear to get the dye smell off. I've had no issues with it, and am now second guessing not getting another one...",1,0,1,1
portludlowjude,"It was too short, making the band at my neck/shoulder level was very tight.  The bottom openings for the legs were so large they fit half way over my butt cheeks.  Very uncomfortable.  The hook at the back of the neck was also very hard to hook up.",-1,0,0,0
Anonymous,"Big chested ladies: just buy this! This suit is supportive and attractive. I am a 36DDD, and wear a dress/pant size of 14. I bought the suit in a L (12/14). Typically the only swimsuits that both fit and support me are halter tops which dig into the back of my neck and hurt. This suit supports without putting any pressure on my neck. The fabric is forgiving around my stomach and not overly tight anywhere.The only downside is that the material is thin. I’m not sure how this will hold up against repeated use over the summer.",1,-1,0,0
Nancy Higgins,I am 69yrs. 5’6” and weight 127#. I ordered a small and it is perfect. Good quality and color is as described. Only issue is I have a swimmers back so my husband did not like the way the back looked. Easy fix is I left it unhooked and removed hooks. Perfect. I ordered another style on Amazon and if it doesn’t work will return it for another one of this style different color.,-1,1,1,0
moises miera,"Can work for maternity swimwear! I bought my normal size L, but the size of my belly at 26w is pulling the suit down on my shoulders and up in the crotch area. At least I hope that's what is happening as Im 5'10 and normally 164lbs (175lbs pregnant at the moment). I'm totally in love with the design, it was exactly as pictured and well sewn. The picture was true to color.  I really wanted to wear this weekend but I'm going to have to exchange for a XL to accommodate my pregnant belly.",1,0,1,0
Sheila O.,"Love this suit!!! When I opened the box I was thrilled with how bright the blue color was. I tried it on ASAP and fit perfectly! I have an hour glass shape and it fits great on top and on the bottom. I’m 5’2”, 145 lbs., & a 38D. I ordered a medium and can’t believe how well it fits! The bottom doesn’t cut into my legs, the top provides great boob support and the material is so soft. It’s full coverage with a sexy twist. I’ll probably buy it in a few colors. Such an awesome find, perfect timing for summer!",1,0,1,1
jadding,"I wanted to love this swimsuit. The colors, the price, the fit, everything about it looked amazing. Except the fit wasn't. For reference, I'm a 36DD that's breastfed two children. I'm not sure what category that leaves me in, but this lacked support, which in turn made the top look loose and frumpy. The midsection was amazing, great for hiding a soft tummy, but ultimately I had to send it back because I wasn't happy with how much work I had to put in to keep the girls in the right location.",-1,0,1,0

Amazon Customer,"I bought this swimsuit for a trip to the indoor waterpark over the Christmas holiday.  To help my curvaceous sisters out there I wanted to leave a review because several other ladies did the same.  I am a ""G"" cup and this fit my top half well and looked attractive. Only downside, as some reviewers said, is the cups are like free-floating shoulder pads and offer no support.  It is true but casual use it is fine.  I need something with more support but for lounging by the pool with a few dips it is great.My hips didn't look bad and while is was slightly too big it wasn't noticeable.  The legs are cut higher than I expected so I had to do some more grooming so keep that in mind and try on before you leave.",-1,0,0,-1
lidamari,"This is a very sexy swimsuit. The green color really flatters my olive skin tone. The high neckline helps accentuate sculpted shoulders and the ruched piece helps hide belly bulge (if any).  The mesh makes it sexy but still tasteful for those that are worried about the girls hanging out.  I like that it has full coverage on the back.  The swimsuit is true to size.  I ordered a small, which is what I generally wear in all bathing suits.  If you are between sizes, I would size up.",1,0,1,1
Courtney K.,"Great for an Amazon bathing suit!  I am 33 yo, 5’8, 175 pounds. The color I picked was deep purple. I picked the fit based in size chart. I like the cut because I have broad shoulders and the halter cut was very flattering.  The color that came was a little off... I would say still in the purple color family, just more of a deep magenta. I will say that if you have cellulite in your butt, it will show some but not enough to make me feel self conscious (trust me, I am easily self conscious in a bathing suit). The mesh in front and back are a nice part of the swimsuit. Overall, solid fabric and solid clasp for the back of neck. I would buy this again in another color.  I only gave it 4 stars because the color was a little off from what I ordered.",1,1,-1,1

I love that my toddler and baby can't pull it down.",1,0,0,1

Angela Victoria,"Fit better than expected, feels reasonably substantial,  and I love the way it looks.Looking forward to pool time, its sexy without showing too much skin or making me worry that without constant adjusting I'll show more than intended.

jules0321,"I typically size up in one piece bathing suits or they run too short and pull at my shoulders. I ordered a medium in this because it says that’s a 10-12 and I wear an 8. It’s definitely as flattering as everyone has said, but it was indeed too short for me and pulled in the back and shoulders. I liked it enough to order it again in a large - fingers crossed it fits better!",-1,0,0,0
Jmarie,"I got this as so many others indicated it fit so well and OMG, I am in Love! I ordered a 1x because I have a very large bust (36J) and wanted to make sure it fit well in the top. It is a bit larger in the waist as a result, but, it fits perfectly in the top and makes me feel sexy, without having to worry if I am going to have any issues. Very happy with this swimsuit!",1,0,0,0
JCA,"This suit is really sexy and flattering.  Hides tummy well.  I am a size 8 with 36DD bust, so finding a flattering suit that still gives coverage and support is a bonus.  But the coverage for my rear is not what I hoped for.  I liked it well enough that I kept it and wore a black swim skirt over it.  If I were a few years younger, the rear coverage might have been okay, but at 59 I feel better with more full fit on bottom.",1,0,0,1
Nikki,"Finding a swimsuit to fit my large bust is close to an impossible task. However, this one is perfect! I hate shopping for swimsuits so I ordered several online to try them on. As soon as I put this on I knew it was “the one”! It covers enough to make me feel comfortable but shows just enough to make me feel sexy. Also first bathing suit I’ve had in a long time that wasn’t black. Love love love it. So glad that I found it!",1,0,0,1
Amazon Customer,"I love the color and style of this suit! It’s modest (which is what I need for chasing my toddler around the pool) yet stylish. I was worried it wouldn’t be long enough, seeing the size chart but after reading reviews I decided to try. It’s a tad short for me, resulting in a bit more showing on my rear, but still good coverage. (I’m 5’9” and ordered the large) I got a compliment on it the first time I wore it and am happy with the design.",-1,0,1,1
Blossom,"I really like this suit. I kept reading reviews that the leg holes were a little small but I found that the leg holes fit fine, it's the arm holes that are a little small- basically the cutout of the arm towards your back isn't quite as big as it could be to be super comfortable. However, as I wore it, it did seem to fit better, I don't know if it's that it stretched a little or I just got used to it? If the arm cutout was a little bigger, this would definitely get 5 stars from me. But even without that, it is still a really great suit. I got it in red and it looks just like the picture. Great quality especially for the price!",1,1,1,0
Amazon Customer,Pretty impressed. Went off of other reviews for size but I usually like to size up one in bathing suits especially since I am a larger bust and this seems to he the issue in many suits. I am 5'4" and roughly 185lbs. I wear a 42 DD. I bought the size 16 and plan on buying more but may be sizing up again only because of my bust. I gave it 4 stars only because I wish it fit better in my bust but overall happy.,-1,0,0,0
Danielle,"I sent this back- I'm very picky about suits but was thrilled at price and great reviews. I can see where it would be very flattering on most people.

I loved the color and style.",-1,0,1,1
l cooke,"I loved this suit. As a mother of two I wanted something pretty, stylish but still reserved so I can pick up the little ones.

Keith’s wife,Color is more of a red tone and not as “deep  purple” as the stock image(slightly upset by this). Overall fit is great. 5’2 135# and ordered a Medium. Some reviews mentions poor sewing.

Jessie Booker,Honestly I looked A long time for the best bathing suit for my body. I read The reviews on this one and I’m so glad I did. It fits great. Supports what it needs to. I do Not have pictures to post but I assure You the green one I ordered is perfection. The color is exact. Fits great. I am 5’4”. 227 pounds. I wear Size 16 so I ordered the large/2x.

Brandi,"5'7"" 160lbs ordered large and it was a bit too snug for my height. I was nervous about ordering an XL given I am small chested.  Decided to give it a try as I loved the style of the bathing suit being very modest with a touch of show, and was very happy with my exchange!  The removable cups are a little large given it is an XL so I may swap them out for smaller ones from another suit but overall fit and style was exactly what I wanted.",1,0,0,1

Melissa,This swimsuit is very flattering.  I ordered a size up because of reviews about tight legs.  I found the legs to be looser than I expected.  The style is great.

I will definitely sterilize it before wearing it.,1,0,0,1

Kim Wolfgang,I was extremely skeptical about ordering a bathing suit from the Amazon.  Bathing suit shopping is not something I particularly enjoy.  I ordered exactly what size I thought I should and it fits amazing!  I could not believe how flattering the style is. This is the first not black bathing suit I have had in over 10 years!!,1,0,0,1
Wolfgang,Heavily disappointed in this swimsuit after hearing SO many good things about it. Warning to ALL TALL LADIES: you need to size UP. This swimsuit was made for a short torso. Exchanging now. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it's a flattering fit...it's just soooooo not made for tall women. And I'm only 5'9".,-1,0,0,0

Runawaypony,"Bought this for a more modest but still cute swimsuit. Fits the bill perfectly. It's a little low on the thighs for my liking but does not cut in and create lines/indent in the upper thigh. Fits well dry and wet (sometimes suits stretch/sag when wet). The ruching is a nice addition, can arrange it to cover any small tummy bumps. Overall, very nice modest but fun suit for the price. Would love if it came in some patterns, would totally buy another one.",0,0,0,1

The swimsuit is not designed to have enough space to hold it all together to avoid spillage on the sides. The color is nice, just as you see in the picture.

Rated 4 starts because the coverage on the butt is not as much as I'd like. We'll see what happens when it gets wet.

LV,"Just what I was looking for! Perfect for postpartum. I’m 5’4, 145 lbs and 8 weeks postpartum and I needed a suit that was comfortable, covered my belly, but wasn’t sooo conservative and this was great! Comfortable with a side of sexy.",1,0,0,1
MSR,"After trying two other navy suits and returning them, I ordered this one based on the reviews. It was a good decision. I love the way this fits, and it is very flattering. I typically don’t wear such high necklines-too constricting- and ended up loosening this one by letting out the end that hooks, which helped. I recommend this suit.",1,0,0,1
Daniel,"I'm a solid medium in clothes, smaller (ish) boobs- B cup, size 6 in pants.  I have an athletic build and this suit fits PERFECTLY.  It IS a bit narrowly cut in the butt, but this is more the style these days.  I absolutely love this suit; I've never bought a suit on Amazon and was a little skeptical, but this fit perfectly.",1,0,0,1
James Ratley,"This is the MOST Comfortable slim wear I have ever worn.  I am 5'3"" tall and way 150 lbs. I ordered a large.  When I received  the slim wear it looked so small I was sure I ordered the wrong size, but when I tried it on, EUREKA!!! I am ordering more",-1,1,0,0
Tracey Eberhardt,"This suit is great! I am 5’8” and 160lb. I first ordered a large, which was definitely wearable, but I have a very long torso and also ordered an x-large which I like better. I wear a 34DD. The top is great but larger boobs should also fit in an XL. I was worried you would see too much boob through the sheer part but it’s perfect. My butt is a little big but not really big and not very firm. I could use a little more butt coverage but it’s not creeping up crack or anything.",1,0,0,0
CdnMum,"I typically spend $100+ on suits, but the quality is on point and my suits always last. The material on this suit is sub-par. I would guess that after a few swims it will not hold up well. More for fashion than function. Cute style though.",0,-1,0,1
Caribbean Lawyer,I ordered this product in wine red and the colour and style were exactly as pictured. I love it. I plan to wear this as a top rather than as swimwear. There is padding at the bust but thankfully its removable because those pads are not the same shape as these boobies!,-1,0,1,1
Remie R.,"I ordered a medium and am exchanging for a large. I am 5’6”, 140 pounds, B chest. The medium fit, but the length of the suit was not long enough for me so it made it a little tight. Otherwise, I love it and so does my husband!",-1,0,0,0
CB,"This bathing suit is excellent.  Enough of coverage but still sexy.  It seems to be a bit tight fitting in the neck area so I don't know if ordering a size up would help or not.  I ordered two of these, one in black and one in red.  They do not fit exactly the same.  The black one is tighter in the neck than the red.  But I will still wear them.  It is not that annoying.  This suite looks good on any body type.",-1,0,0,1
Carl,I purchased the teal color it is just beautiful.  The fit is great the price is right.  I’m 5’6 155  my measurements are 38 ddd 33 W and 39 hips.  When buying a 1 piece it’s hard to find one that fits on top and will be tight enough at the bottom.  This worked,1,0,1,0
Kindle Customer,"I'm a petite person (5'3"" or 160cm). So I thought meyba the swimsuit torso will be too long, but I was pleasantly surprised to say that it fit perfectly. I ordered a size L because I'm a 36 D, and my breasts are comfortable and secure. All good. I had absolutely no problem with the fit at all. I just hated the breast pads, they are basically useless.",1,0,0,0
A. Foster,I was worried this suit wouldn't fit but at this price and the positive reviews gave it a shot and was SUPER happy with it. The fit is perfect and as described. Wouldn't change a thing about it and now Im thinking about buying a 2nd one in a different color.,1,0,0,0
Emerson Douglas Pacheco,"It is a very nice swimming suit and the top pads are nice , the material is thick enough.I had ordered a XS, for reference I’m 5’7” , 122lbs. It is a little tight in length but I’m still keeping it, so if you are tall size up would be a good option. Fast deliver",1,1,0,1
stacy pipkin,This suit is extremely flattering. I think if you have a very large chest you might not love it - I am a D cup...maybe DD in some bras and this fits fine but I have to "re-adjust" occasionally. But it's so beautiful I really don't mind.,1,0,0,1
Jennifer Lynne,This bathing suit is EVERYTHING! Ridiculously comfortable and it fits perfectly! I get so many compliments when I wear it! It's so flattering and hides what you need it to! I like it so much I recently bought it in another color.,1,1,0,1
Amazon Customer,"I loathe the bathing suit but have no fear wearing this. Aside from the padding being a little funky, it really does hide the extra love handles. Comfy as well. Although I slightly prefer the Zando Women's Tummy Control Swimsuit Mesh Vintage Ruched Swimwear Strappy One Piece, this is a plus!!!",0,0,0,0
Gary W.,"I have recently gained a lot of weight due to a new medication I've started & its taking a lot to get used too.. I haven't owned a one piece since i was a kid  & I would have NEVER imagined myself buying one at age 25 lol but I'm glad i did. I really like this bathing suit, It fits perfectly other than being just a little bit bigger in the chest area. I ordered the 14 ( 0X ) based on another woman's review who was about the same size as me. I'm 5'9,  200lbs and i typically wear M/L in shirts and 12/XL in pants.",1,0,0,0

Amazon Customer,"This swim suit is so pretty! I never expected to feel so secure, confident, and sexy in swimwear. This really exceeded my expectations. The neck clasp is a bit hard to deal with, but that’s my only complaint. I’m around a size 12 and ordered a size L.",1,0,0,1
Macho Mama,"Wore on vacation with my husband for our anniversary. Sexy without the bare skin; I felt comfortable and my husband liked that I was still showing off the girls. I especially love the back mesh detailFor reference: 38DD, size 12/14Wearing size L in suit comfortably",1,0,0,1
Nik,"I love this suit. Its flattering and comfortable. Hides imperfections. Not a ton of breast support, but good for not having underwire. So far my favorite one piece. I'm 5'6 and 175lbs and a large fit perfect. Hope this helps!",1,0,0,1
Diana,"I love this suit everywhere... except in back. 5’10” and I’ve tried this swimsuit in two sizes. In the end, there’s just not enough coverage in back while chasing after kids. Really nice otherwise! If they changed that one aspect, I’d buy it in every color.",-1,0,0,0
MAK DADDY,"This suit is seriously hot. Im sure the tan lines will suck but I'll be in the shade so I dont care. Usually I buy a size bigger because I have a large bust,  but I bought it in the size below as well and that one fits perfectly. I'll probably keep the bigger one in case i dont feel like sucking in my stomach",1,0,0,0
Shadowrider1950,"I am 6', 200 lbs.  The 1X was a bit too big and loose so very little breast support although I did like the bum coverage.  The suit is well made and good quality. However, I found the high neckline strap uncomfortable and choking so even if it had been the right size, I doubt I would have kept it..",-1,1,0,0
Amazon Customer,This Baiting suit is awesome it does such a wonderful job with my figure I am 63 years old grandmother of seven and I’m telling you I look like a hot mama it is so beautiful it’s certainly give you the curves that you need and I would buy another one in a minute in a different style,0,0,0,1
a.brown,"I am 5'1 and 122, large C cup. I read the reviews and decided to get the medium. A small would probably fit but the legs holes and chest area might have been a bit tight. The medium is a little loose around the tummy(meaning that this suit has plenty of strech) but it does not hang off or look bad. The mesh looks good and the suit dries fast.",-1,0,0,0
Amazon Customer,"Found the same suit for $12 on Walmart. Kinda disappointing I found it cheaper after buying. The suit is super cute! I just think I ordered too big. I’m a size 18, 40DDD and carry my weight pretty evenly. I ordered a size 18 and honestly could have gone down a size. It slipped on no problem (too loose, aren’t you suppose to squeeze a bit into swimsuits? Haha) and the chest isn’t tight enough to provide support, I’m not looking for a Janet Jackson Super Bowl moment lol. I love the suit & think I’ll order a 16 in a different color.",-1,0,0,0

matsona89,"Oh my goodness, this bathing suit is everything I was hoping for! I ordered a large since I usually buy 8/10 and was hoping for enough room. It was definitely the right fit. There was enough room for my thighs as well and nothing felt snug in the wrong places. The top part was flattering and had a good fit. I also loved the color and the mesh. I can highly recommend this! To help other ladies, I'm 5'6, 155 lbs. and 36C.",1,0,0,1

Katie,"I bought this bathing suit last minute before vacation. It's awesome, very flattering, and my most comfortable bathing suit. The only thing was the clasp was kind of screwed up, but it doesn't stop me from wearing it and I still love it for the price. Also, no one else really posted about that, so I'm sure it's not likely to happen repeatedly.",0,0,0,1
