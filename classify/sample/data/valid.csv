joshulin,"This bathing suit is so flattering! I’m 4’11 with 38DDD bust & size 8 in pants, it’s very hard for me to find bathing suits that flatter my body! This one is perfect! I ordered the XL specifically for my chest & it fit how I wanted with a tiny bit more room!",1,0,0,1
Amanda LaMonica,LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I'm 5'4" and 140 lbs. I'm more of a pear shape and typically wear a medium in everything. Based off other reveiws I ordered a large. This bathing suite made me write a review because of how well it fit and is very flattering (and looking at other reviewers its great for any body type!). Get this suit!,1,0,0,0
pghpetphotog,"I'm 5'9"" and 125lbs, so finding a one-piece that fits is like finding the Holy Grail.  This one is comfortable, cute, and true to color.  It held up really well in the mineral pools we frequented, and I'm sure it will do just as well at the beach.  Arrived quickly and neatly packaged.",1,0,1,1
Hutto,"I've bought FIVE of these, I'm so in love with them! The fit is great and so flattering, the quality is fantastic, and you cannot beat this price! I told my boyfriend I got it on Amazon, and he said ""it looks like it's from Victoria's Secret!""",0,1,0,1
Adele C.,Beautiful suit.  I did return the first suit due to it running a little large in the legs.  The next size down fit much better.  I replaced the cups in the suit with more supportive ones and now the suit is perfect.  I ordered both the black suit and the teal.  Very pleased.,-1,0,1,0
M. Bowen,"This suit is super cute, my daughter got loads of compliments. However the quality is really lacking. After maybe 15 times wearing this suit (and properly taking care of it), the elasticity is gone and it is seriously sagging. Bummer because it was so cute but I’m not going to buy another.",0,-1,0,1
Jessica,Love this suit!  I live in the water during the summer and go through a few swimsuits each summer.  Love this way more than I expected!  5’8” 200# 40DD.  1XL was perfect.  Ordering 2 more right now!,1,0,0,0

Bewitched21,"I cant believe that this suit fits as well as it does for not even trying it on before buying! I am 5'7"" 155 (36C, 31 in waist and about 39 hips) and ordered a large,fits perfect. Probably going to order more colors. Love it!!",1,0,0,0
Missy J.,"A gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous suit. Photos don’t do it justice. I’m 5’2”, 145lb, and SUPER busty - ordered a large and it fits perfectly. Slimming AND sexy. I’m not a huge fan of things around my neck, and this neckline DOES feel a little snug but you adjust to it pretty quick",-1,0,0,1

Amazon Customer,Love everything about this swimsuit! It is extremely flattering on most body types! I recommend going up a size to be sure it fits. Use the seller size guides to be sure I got the right size.,1,0,0,0
Amazon Customer,"I liked the look of this bathing suit and for the price, I had to give it a try! I ordered the navy blue in a XL. For reference, I’m 5 6, C cup and 185 pounds. It was too large up top, fit nicely in the waist and legs but felt like it was missing material on the butt! I’ll have I wear a pair or shorts while walking around. Overall, it’s worth it for an extra bathing suit but I wish I would have tried the plus size 14. Maybe it would have fit better on top and had more coverage of my behind!",-1,0,0,0
InVinoVeritas,"Love it. To give a reference point, I am 5’7, about 130lbs give or take and 34C.  I got a medium. Fits awesome through tummy and chest. A teeny bit snug (snug is actually a harsh word for what it is) on the bottom. But the next size up wouldn’t fit right either. I will say that if you have pronounced collar bones, the straps might be a bit tight. So the long torso girls like myself, just be aware.",-1,0,0,0
Nicole H,Very nice flattering swimsuit. I'm 5' 7" and sometimes buying one pieces can be tricky because the length of the torso. This one fit like a glove and it keeps excess fat in check....or at least is does for me.,1,0,0,1
Sarah,"I really love this swimsuit.  I was a little worried because it was so inexpensive, but it looks and fit better that swimsuits that I have purchased for 3 times the price.  I am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and the large fit great.",1,0,0,0
Tdub,I just lost 50 pounds and this is the first nice swim suit I have bought myself in over 10 years!!! Fits amazing and my triple d’s look great!!!! Good support everywhere. Only negative is the pads I’ll be removing them.,-1,0,0,0
First Time Mom,"I love it! Looks great. The straps up top are a bit tight, but not a deal breaker at all. The material tends to ride up a little on the butt cheeks. Would recommend sizing up if you favor in your bottom side. I love the color. I have a boyshort bottom that I will probably wear over it and the shape is so flattering. Very slimming in the midsection.",-1,0,1,0
Tara Hennessy,"I got a large since I'm between a 6/8 on most days. Its a little snug in the breasticle area but, you know that's just added support I guess. Everything else got comfortably. Looks damn good as well.",1,0,0,1
nursenae215,I'm a size M and i got a size m and it fits good.  Perfect for running after my toddler at the pool and also stylish at the same time.  Only issue its so good 3 other people at the pool has the same one.  But thankfully we all had different colors.,1,0,0,1
Shannon Walters,Size:XL I’m speechless how sexy and lovely this swimsuit is! I’m 5’4 200lbs with most weight in my hips and butt and this suit is omg sexy! No fat ha going anywhere because the shear back with keyhole. And the tummy style hides my tummy. Fully covers my butt and makes my 38DDD look S-E-X-Y!

Krystal Solano,The suit is very flattering.  Bought it for a spa day and was complimented the entire day!  I am a size 10/12 and it is true to size and the fit itself is great.

Meg,This swimsuit is stylish and comfy! I ordered a L (I’m 5’1” and 150 lbs) and it fits great. I got several compliments on it. I switch out this swimsuit and another one because this swimsuit will leave weird tan lines!!,1,0,-1,0
Tabitha O.,"Cute bathing suit that looks really good with fake breasts.  My only complaint is in the back where the lace strap meets the rest of the material, there’s a little fat bulge.  Kind of like the little bugles you get from a bra.",-1,0,0,1
Lindsey Ells,"Suit fit true to size. Makes bust looks sexy, but not trashy. Wish the butt fit was a bit more cheeky as is a full coverage bottom. Also the back of suit goes up a little high and creates kind of a back fat bulge for me...but overall happy with suit!",-1,0,0,1
Amazon Customer,"I absolutely love this suit.  After having two kids in the past three years (my youngest is now 6 months old and I’m still breastfeeding), this swimsuit looks unbelievably amazing on me. And trust me, NOTHING looks amazing on me right now. Even normal clothes. To day this about a swimsuit is unheard of. It’s incredibly flattering and hides all your bad spots.

I honestly am tempted to wear this with some shorts as an outfit!",1,0,0,1
Toni R. Wise,Ordered once and it was too small (runs small).  Ordered it again and it fits great but the mesh is coming apart from the bathing suit.  So disappointed.  Was suppose to use it on my trip that I’m going on right at this moment.  So frustrating.,-1,0,0,0
Kaitlyn,All the reviews were so convincing I was super excited to get mine.  I followed the sizing and paid attention to the comments in other reviews.  Everything fit nice except the leg holes...way too tight.  I'm 5'4 and 143 lbs. not super small but not excessively large.,-1,0,0,0
Jenn Morin,"I HATE swimsuits. HATE. I’ve been desperate to find a decent suit I don’t look/feel like a stuff sausage in. I’ve had 3 kids and I’ve not found ANYTHING I’ve felt comfortable in....until this suit. It is flattering, and I can breath with my gut hanging out and I still look decent. I bought a kimono for a coverup and it’s long enough to cover my extra couple butts.I give this suit a 4, only because I still feel it’s impossible to feel comfortable half naked in front of my father inlaw And swimsuits don’t deserve 5 stars.I found height and weight helpful from others when ordering, so FYI... I’m 5’5 and 147#",1,0,0,0
R. Kisner,"I was very hesitant to buy a swimming suit online, but after looking at stores around me, and not finding anything I liked, I decided to go for it. I'm SO glad I did!

Vicky,LOVEEEEEE this! I get SO many compliments on how flattering it is. It’s my first one piece in YEARS but the breast area has that sexy mesh so I don’t feel so plain. I recently had my 1st baby and this makes me feel so flattering at the beach. It’s also super easy to BF my son because I just unhook the part behind the neck and take one shoulder out. It’s perfect!,1,0,0,1
Ashley campbell,"So I really love the style and pretty much everything about this suit, it is super flattering in all the right places.  However, I wanted to write this review for the taller ladies that it is just a smidge too short.  I am 5'10"" and it kinda feels like I'm getting a wedgie in the front and back I would imagine anyone taller than me would find it intolerable.  I think it's mostly due to the high neck and how it hooks in the back.  I'm still keeping it tho cause I feel awesome in it hopefully it will work I'll just be doing a lot of adjusting!!",-1,0,0,0
E. M.,I LOVE this suit! It came in as fast as expected and it’s AWESOME. I’m 5’9 and 180lbs i wear roughly an 8 in jeans. I recently gained a lot of weight fast so I have a stubborn belly and hips. This suit is wonderful for hiding trouble spots like a belly or unwantedback fat showing. I felt confident the second i put it on and that never happens! I love this suit on my curves but honestly I think it would look cute on any body style,1,0,0,1
Rupal,The cut of this suit is flattering so I love it. Boyfriend loves it as well. Fit was as expected so take a look at the size guide. Comfortable to wear and doesn't squeeze in at the upper thigh area. It clasps behind neck.I bought it in red. No issues with quality and everything looks great so far.,1,1,1,1
Elizabeth D,"Ladies! This is a must buy.It is flattering, modest with a hint of sexy. Not too revealing but just enough. Perfect for moms who want to look like a young mom and not an old grandma. Fits true to size. Covers butt pretty well. Love it.",1,0,0,1
Gabrielle G,"The quality of this bathing suit is excellent, I’m also very pleased with the gorgeous color. The only issue I have is that it’s baggy on me. I read the reviews, and still thought I’d ordered the correct size. With bathing suits, I typically size up. That’s not necessary with this suit.",1,1,1,0
OP,"I'm a full figured gal, 5'5 and I wear an 18 in Old Navy jeans. I was worried this wouldn't fit, but it slips right on, holds everything right where it should be, and is very flattering. You can see cleavage, but thanks to the mesh it's no too revealing. My husband loves this on me! I'll be buying a second one in another color.",1,0,1,1
Alyssa Forvour,"I bought it as a maternity swimsuit for a vacation.I don't think it will last for several seasons, but I only need it for a week of vacation anyway, so it will work perfect for me.The only minus is that neck is a little bit too tight, other than that it fits great.",-1,0,0,0
Greg & Dharma,"I love this suit. I have hated one pieces for so long and I dislike how high cut they can be, and how little support in the chest there is.

Emily Larsen,"Okay, maybe not my whole life...but at least for my whole 30's. It has a little sass to it with the mesh cutouts but it fits like a dream. And...the ruching! A middle aged mom's dream come true. I don't feel old enough to be rocking one of those suits with a long skirt, but I don't want to be embarrassing our teens at the beach either. This suit is absolutely amazing. It fit very true to size and the price point was amazing too. Love it. Like...I might need to buy it in another color already.",1,0,1,1

Larry S.,I first want to thank everyone who reviewed and said "buy it!" I have never felt more comfortable and confident in a swim suit. I never thought I would say that. This suit provides just enough slimming in the tummy area but without being constricting. If you are between sizes definitely order up.,1,0,0,1
Courtney fox,"I’m really happy with this suit . I’m about 5’3 and 118 lbs I got the small and it fits perfect. I haven’t worn in water or washed so I will update when I do. The chest is pretty supportive , not 100% but good enough",1,0,0,1

TRV,I’ve been trying to find a one piece that I can wear with my kids but doesn’t look like a “mom” suit.  The front of this is very flattering and it seems like it will hold up well.  The butt isn’t the most flattering but not many suits are.,1,0,0,1

kcgrif,"I haven't felt comfortable in a swimming suit in 5 years (since before the birth of our 2 children). This suit is amazing! Extremely flattering. The mesh in the back is perfectly placed as it hides some ""back fat"", if you will. It's just tight enough to help hold in stubborn bellies too! I wish this came in multiple colors/designs because I would get them all. It's a perfect suit to still feel sexy in. I'm 5'3"", 150lbs, athletic build and the medium fits perfectly! Highly recommended!",-1,0,0,1
Katie Berry,I LOVE this suit- it holds you in and gives you a bit of shape. I did size down however it is still comfortable and helps hold my breasts together. I was worried they would be falling all over because I had never purchased a swim suit online before. I would buy this again!,-1,0,0,0

bes,I read a lot of reviews before ordering. I ordered a size larger as many noted that it was tight in the legs. I was concerned as I am bottom heavy but this was not a problem at all. My only critique is that the padding in the cups is a little small. I found it to be an adorable suit.,-1,0,0,1
Gladys,This bathing suit is comfortable and looks great. The price can not be beat. The only thing is that the quality is just okay. The fabric is fine just some of the stitch work is a little off. But for the price it is great.,1,1,0,1
refchick247,"Love the front of this bathing suit.  However, the butt area of the swim suit is cut more narrowly than expected and exposes a little too much for my liking.  I contemplated keeping it because it really is adorable, but in the end, I realized I would not wear it in front of anyone else because they would see too much of my butt.  For a thinner build, or a small-bottomed woman, this would be great.  I'm a pretty average build, size 12 and got the XL.  Aside from the narrow cut, it fit perfectly and is a beautiful, quality made suit.  A little more fabric on the backside would have made this a 5 star review.",-1,1,0,1

Rachel,I had a swimsuit from previous years that I could have worn but with little kids I really wanted a one piece.  Didn't feel like I had time to go to the store so I thought on the off chance that I would order this and see if it worked.  It was the only swimsuit I ordered and I only ordered one size.  I am now done swimsuit shopping.  It fits great and the red color is pretty.,1,0,1,0
Lisa Brickman,"5’6 size 14. I went with the 14 plus and it is almost loose. I may have to order another size smaller later. I appreciate the fit being true to size.

This is the just right type of sexy without being too much. I bought a small (which normally I am between a small and medium) bc I wanted to make sure my boobs were supported.

Ashley D.,"I got the swimsuit in a large wine color and it definitely was a bit too small on me, which flattened my chest and accentuated my stomach area.

Shannon M Kirsop,"I love this suit! I’m 5’8” 170lb 36DD and the large fits like a dream. Apparently I have a long torso, so every other one piece I’ve tried has been too short, but this one is long enough and fits so well.There’s a double layer of fabric on the tummy so it helps keep everything in place but I wouldn’t say it minimizes.There are small round pads in the cups but they tend to move when the suit is wet and it looks a bit odd. You can take them out, just watch out when you get cold!",1,0,0,0
Brittney Galish,This suit makes you look about 10-15 lbs lighter. I will be ordering more. I have the navy blue and it fit like a glove. One thing to watch though is the tan line on the chest. I forgot to spray sunblock there. Best suit and great price!,1,0,1,1
C. Rowe,"LOVE! - I bought this for our honeymoon trip & ended up wearing this suit the most. So flattering, comfortable and doesn’t “ride up”! Really great quality & thick material. Probably one of the best suits I’ve bought.",1,1,0,1
Natalia Sunkarova,Just get the suit!!! I was actually shocked at how great this suit made me look... I bought the pinkish one in large ( I wear 12/14) I am 5’3 with a D chest... ( hope the stats help) and it was a perfect fit! I always dread swimsuit season but I can’t wait go to the pool/beach in this suit. It holds everything in nicely and seems to flatten the tummy area. I loved it so much I immediately ordered 2 more in blue & black!!,1,0,1,1
Julia,I don’t ever write reviews but this product fits amazing! I am very picky about bathing suits especially after having two kids close in age my body dramatically changed. It is very flattering and comfortable. I ordered size large and the fit was perfect! I was very nervous about buying bathing suit online but I am extremely happy customer . For reference I am 5’5 and 150 lbs. I ordered size large and it was comfortable! I can’t wait to order more bathing suits from this seller .,1,0,0,0
Gaby,"I ordered this bathing suit for same day delivery when I realized that I needed a bathing suit for a trip and had no idea where mine were. I was SO pleasantly surprised with this suit! I teeter totter between a M & L and went for the large because I didn’t want it to squeeze anything. The bathing suit was flattering, comfortable, and stylist! I couldn’t have been happier!",1,0,0,1
Phatgurlslym,"Fit well, just a tad bit too small in bust area, I’d say if you’re large chested (i’m 36 DDD, hourglass shape, and wear size 14) I wouldn’t order.",-1,0,0,0
Ashley A,I love it. Sexy but modest at the same time. I’m 5’3 and I wear a US size 4; I got a Small and it fits perfectly.,1,0,0,1
